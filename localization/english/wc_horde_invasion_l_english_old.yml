 WCHOI_2_TITLE:0 "The Invasion from Draenor"
 WCHOI_2_DESC:0 "A storm brews over the southern reaches of Azeroth, within the Black Morass. A gateway, the Dark Portal, has been opened to a dying world known as Draenor — home to wild beasts, orcs, ogres and many other vile creatures. Bloodthirsty and in search of new lands, the orcish clans have united beneath a powerful Warchief who rules the Horde with an iron first. Now they seek to go through the Dark Portal and conquer Azeroth!"
 WCHOI_2_OPT_A:0 "Lok'tar ogar!"
 WCHOI_2_OPT_B:0 "Let us wait and see what happens."
 WCHOI_2_OPT_C:0 "Something must be done about this!"
 
 WCHOI_3_DESC:0 "It is time to stop this carnage. The Horde has conquered enough land to start a new life in Azeroth. Many orcs are returning to their families, burying their axes in the ground. They have vowed to forget the horrors of war that they had to go through. The warlords of the Horde still pose a threat to some parts of Azeroth, but the bloodiest wars are behind us since the clans no longer see the point in keeping the Horde united."
 WCHOI_3_OPT_A:0 "The orcs need their warchief!"
 WCHOI_3_OPT_B:0 "We will go our own way."
 ITS_OVER:0 "It is over..."

 horde_invite_bloodthirsty_clans_desc:0 "A lot of orcs are left beyond the Dark Portal. We need all the clans, if we want to gain a foothold in Azeroth."
 horde_invite_bloodthirsty_clans_tooltip:1 "Gets [special_troops|E] and creates #high 2#! new [vassals|E]"
 horde_invite_bloodthirsty_clans_confirm:0 "Summon them"
 
 LOKTAR_OGAR:0 "Lok'tar ogar!"
 EVTDESC_WCFTW_4:0 "Draenor continues to slowly die. Now, none of the orcs have a desire to remain on a perishing world. Those who were left on Draenor are now hungry, sick and insane... but have crossed the line between the worlds. Among them are the most bloodthirsty bands of orcs, who inspire fear and respect in other, less virulent clans. The clans of the Burning Blade and the Dragonmaw will overwhelm anyone who stands in the way of the Horde."

 WCHOI_3_OPT_A_ALT:0 "We need our warchief!"

 WCHOI_1000_TITLE:0 "The Opening of the Dark Portal"
 WCHOI_1000_DESC:0 "My entire body trembles as I utter the final syllables of the incantation. The storm roars with intensified fury, as if the heavens themselves refuse what I am about to do.\n\nBefore me, the stones shift with a terrifying rumble as the Dark Portal rises, immense and menacing. Its dark energy pulses through the air, and a magical vortex swirls around its frame. There is no turning back now...\n\nI raise my arms, invoking the forces of the Nether, and with a deafening crash, the Portal opens, releasing a chilling mist. I can feel them, on the other side: the orcs.\n\nMy duty fulfilled, I transport myself to Karazhan, exhausted. I light a fire and collapse before the flames, letting out a weary sigh. That wretched warlock... he will betray us, no doubt, but he will have to wait before I deem him worthy of my attention. The fate of the world is sealed, and what I have done today will usher in an era of chaos and unprecedented destruction upon Azeroth."
 WCHOI_1000_A:0 "So it begins... The end of the world."

 WCHOI_1001_TITLE:0 "La Fin"
 WCHOI_1001_DESC:0 ""Si veule… Si misérable ! Tu nourris la flamme que tu contrôlais autrefois ! Que ta carcasse calcinée devienne un don… Pour corriger le cap que tu as détourné !"\n\nNon… NON ! Je l'ai libéré, je suis digne de recevoir sa puissance ! Alors pourquoi cette condamnation ?\n\nEt là, je les vois : d’innombrables démons, les yeux suintant la haine et les rires sadiques. Avant même que je puisse réagir, je sens des griffes acérées me percer le dos. Ils en profitent pour se jeter sur moi, tandis que je tente désespérément de repousser ces créatures, mais leurs griffes continuent de me lacérer encore et encore. Mes os craquent, ma chair est tirée et se déchire sous la force de leurs attaques, leurs hurlements envahissent mes oreilles, et chaque mouvement m’arrache un peu plus de ce qui reste de moi-même.\n\nJe m’effondre au sol, agonisant, mon corps réduit en lambeaux. Non, ça ne peut pas être ainsi… Je suis Gul'dan !"
 WCHOI_1001_A:0 ""Maître ! Non ! Je suis Gul'dan ! Je suis les ténèbres incarnées… Cela ne peut pas… finir ainsi…""

 WCHOI_1002_TITLE:0 "Powerful Magical Disturbance"
 WCHOI_1002_DESC:0 "The world suddenly wavers. An invisible surge cuts through the air, overwhelming and uncontrollable, and I feel the very fabric of magic twisting. This is no ordinary fluctuation. It's something else... something far older and far more terrifying.\n\nA shockwave from a distant place strikes my mind. The magic around me vibrates, out of sync. The air grows heavy, almost suffocating, saturated with this unknown energy. A wave of nausea washes over me, and I stagger, sensing imminent danger.\n\nWhat just happened? I try to understand, but there are no clear signs, no answers. It's neither an attack nor a spell. I'm certain that everywhere, mages are feeling this surge of unnatural power.\n\nNothing will ever be the same again. I know it deep within, even without understanding the cause. A turning point has been reached, but towards what? I fear what is to come."
 WCHOI_1002_A:0 "This bodes ill."
