While Death exists in a natural balance with Life, those living creatures who are able to use magic inevitably seek to stave off death, and in so doing empower death to overcome this balance and bring entropy and decay to thriving ecologies.

Therefore they are frequently the first spells used by spellcasters from cultures of low sophistication, but remain relevant in a purified form through later stages of [development|E]. The four elemental schools are [wc_spell_school_elemental_fire|E], [wc_spell_school_elemental_water|E], [wc_spell_school_elemental_air|E], and [wc_spell_school_elemental_earth|E]. \nAdditionally; there are two approaches to dealing with these elemental spirits; Spirit (often associated with the [wc_spell_school_life|E]), and Decay (often associated with the [wc_spell_school_death|E])"

Some of the forces consider themselves allies and defenders of life, whereas others are hostile to it and seek its destruction for gain or out of principle. Each of these forces has their own set of domains within the cosmos, known as a plane. The [wc_elements], while originating in the material worlds, also each have a plane in the cosmos."
