 wc_horde_invasion.medivh.1000.desc:0 "My entire body trembles as I utter the final syllables of the incantation. The storm roars with intensified fury, as if the heavens themselves refuse what I am about to do.\n\nBefore me, the stones shift with a terrifying rumble as the Dark Portal rises, immense and menacing. Its dark energy pulses through the air, and a magical vortex swirls around its frame. There is no turning back now...\n\nI raise my arms, invoking the forces of the Nether, and with a deafening crash, the Portal opens, releasing a chilling mist. I can feel them, on the other side: the orcs.\n\nMy duty fulfilled, I use the last of my energy to recall myself to Karazhan. I light a fire and collapse before the flames, letting out a weary sigh. That wretched warlock... He will undoubtedly betray us, but he will have to wait before we deem him worthy of our attention. The fate of Azeroth is sealed, and what I have done today will usher in an era of chaos and unprecedented destruction upon our world."
 wc_horde_invasion.magic.1000.desc:0 "The world suddenly wavers. An invisible surge cuts through the air, overwhelming and uncontrollable, and I feel the very fabric of magic twisting. This is no ordinary fluctuation. It's something else... something far older and far more terrifying.\n\nA shockwave from a distant place strikes my mind. The magic around me vibrates, out of sync. The air grows heavy, almost suffocating, saturated with this unknown energy. A wave of nausea washes over me, and I stagger, sensing imminent danger.\n\nWhat just happened? I try to understand, but there are no clear signs, no answers. It's neither an attack nor a spell. I'm certain that everywhere, mages are feeling this surge of unnatural power."
