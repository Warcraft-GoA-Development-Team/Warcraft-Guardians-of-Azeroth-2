# EFFECT LIST
#####################################################################
# !!! Remember to add all new effects with a short description here !!!
#
#  Mediation Event Effects:
#	stewardship_duty_special_2000_sc_mediation_saved_scopes_effect 				- Takes scopes saved as story cycle variables and re-saves them as accessible scopes.
#	stewardship_duty_special_2000_sc_mediation_increase_s1_event_count_effect	- Increments the counter of how many state 1 events have fired (for tracking event completion progress)
#	stewardship_duty_special_2000_sc_mediation_increase_s2_event_count_effect	- Increments the counter of how many stage 2 events have fired (for tracking event completion preogress)
#	stewardship_duty_special_2000_sc_mediation_get_random_quarreler_effect		- Randomly picks one of the two quarrelers and saves their scope for localization usage.
#
#  Map Painting Effects:
#	stewardship_duty_special_1201_map_painting_journey_continuation_effect		- Advances the event chain onto the next step.
#	stewardship_duty_special_1201_conclude_map_painting_effect					- Concludes the event chain.
#
#  Road Building Effects:
#	stewardship_domain_special_1301_increase_road_progress_effect				- Advances the event chain onto the next step.
#	stewardship_domain_special_1301_increase_road_quality_effect				- Improves the final outcome of the event chain when it completes.
#	stewardship_domain_special_1301_decrease_road_quality_effect				- Worsens the final outcome of the event chain when it completes.
#	stewardship_domain_special_1301_automatic_progress_effect					- Used to automatically progress the road's construction over time, without the need to fire repetitive events.
#	stewardship_domain_special_1301_road_building_event_effect					- Fires a random event in the event chain.
#
#  Paton Effects:
#	stewardship_duty_1062_get_client_effect										- If a valid $FLAG$ courtier exists in the pool, save their scope so we don't need to create a new one.
#	stewardship_duty_1062_create_philosopher_effect								- Creates a courtier with the philosopher $FLAG$ and appropriate skills.
#	stewardship_duty_1062_create_gardener_effect								- Creates a courtier with the gardener $FLAG$ and appropriate skills.
#	stewardship_duty_1062_create_poet_effect									- Creates a courtier with the poet $FLAG$ and appropriate skills.
#	stewardship_duty_1064_extend_patronage_term_effect							- Extends the patronage contract for 5 years.
#	stewardship_duty_1064_remove_patrons_buff_effect							- Cleans up residual effects from the patronage contract if it ends early.
#	
#  Domesday Book Effects:
#	stewardship_domain_special_1500_apply_domesday_effects						- Braching script structure to apply all correct effects at the conclusion of the event chain.
#	stewardship_domain_special_1500_apply_domesday_effects_2					- Script sub-structure called within the above effect, but with differing parameters based on what happened during the event chain.
#	stewardship_domain_special_1500_apply_domesday_effects_3					- Script sub-structure called within the above effect, but with differing parameters based on what happened during the event chain.
#	stewardship_domain_special_1500_increase_quality_effect						- Improves the final outcome of the event chain when it completes.
#	stewardship_domain_special_1500_decrease_quality_effect						- Worstens the final outcome of the event chain when it completes.
#	stewardship_domain_special_1500_domesday_cleanup							- Removes all tracking variables & flags for the event chain once it has concluded.

# sell_titles_grant_sufficient_gold_effect - gives the character sufficient gold to pay root
