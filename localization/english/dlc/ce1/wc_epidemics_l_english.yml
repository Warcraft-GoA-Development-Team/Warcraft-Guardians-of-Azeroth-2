 # SS Note - Future updates should only include cities of cultures with Life Expectancy category 2 or less. 
 epidemic_events.5010.stormwind: "Precious few feet now fall on the bridge over the Valley of Heroes. Only the hardiest and most fervent still walk the path towards the plague-stricken city, seeking salvation from the Holy Light even as they themselves succumb to the loathsome sickness.\n\nThe beautiful trade district, so often filled with cheer and good-natured barter, is the refuge of the damned. The Cathedral bells ring mournfully over streets deaf to all but the cries of the afflicted. Putrid bodies float in the canals and loll obliviously against the piers.\n\nThe dead and the dying rattle their last here, pitifully alone."
 epidemic_events.5010.orgrimmar: "The roaring rapids of the Southfury River carry more than just flotsam and traders now. Bloated, sun-bleached corpses are deposited downriver, their agonised faces set in a silent rictus grin, popped buboes livid against the pale skin.\n\nThe solid walls, so many times a guardian against incursion from the living, are now buttressed with the dead. The twisting, narrow streets have become a maze of stacked corpses, rats using the piles as both refuge and sustenance.\n\nWill our people's hard-won unity survive this curse?"
 epidemic_events.5010.lordaeron: "What a tragedy has befallen humankind's greatest city!\n\nCountless souls have walked these venerable roads, but the ranks of the dead swell more swiftly day by day. The scourge sweeps the streets, blighting every pretty plaza and glorious archway. The old marbles stand silently, helpless against the torture of the living. The dying rattle their last, on their lips the words scarcely dared thought of in better times:\n\n"Has the Light forsaken the heirs of Arathor?""
 epidemic_events.5010.boralus: "The gentle tides of Tiragarde Sound happily against the piers of Boralus Harbor, belying the catastrophe on the land.\n\nThe sick shamble hopelessly between ramshackle buildings. Where bakers once hawked their wares lie piles of dead, the living unable to keep up with the tide of sickness constricting the city.\n\nThe scene would nearly be peaceful, were it not for the groans and coughs of the dying."
 epidemic_events.5010.gilneas: "The city of mists, ever dark and dour, is now a tapestry of death.\n\nThe canals are choked with bloated corpses cast hastily aside, suffusing the fog with a miasma of decay. Eldritch chants are heard in the alleys— fragments of long-forgotten prayers spoken in hushed tones as the superstitious and desperate return to the Old Ways.\n\nThe grim and stoic Gilnean people cling to precious life in their homes, sequestered around candles and jealously guarded hoards of precious supplies. Even their great walls and moats could not save them from the invisible threat of disease."
 epidemic_events.5010.thunder_bluff: "The marketplaces and trading squares of the city, so usually bustling with activity, have fallen deathly silent. The proud bridges between the mesa rises are clogged with the sick, the dead cast down in piles for the vultures to feast on below.\n\nThe Elder Rise overlooks the carnage sadly, the ancestral spirits unable to stop so deadly and silent a killer as the dreaded pestilence.\n\nThe City of the Four Spires dies slowly, those vaunted stone pillars unable to keep the sky from falling."
 epidemic_events.5010.ironforge: "What city is more known for its steel than Ironforge? The magma floes feeding the Great Forge have been used to quench the blades of a million swords, but there are some threats no amount of fine craftsmanship can protect from.\n\nIt is a grim irony that the quarreling clans should be so suddenly united in the face of such adversity. The sickness kills without prejudice, laying low all from every walk of life.\n\nThe ancient smithies fall silent. Those who worked them turn their calloused hands to prayer rather than toil, in hope that the divine may save them where a weapon would not."
 epidemic_events.5010.stromgarde: "Ancient beyond measure, Stromgarde has watched the successor lordships of the Arathi Basin rise and fall, yet still it stands strong. It has endured much, but it will need to endure further still.\n\nThe wind that soothed the heart of Thoradin himself today carries death with it as it blows. The malignant dead are carried away by masked soldiers and cast off the ancient parapets into the sea, but more and yet more replace them. The cliffsides are strewn with bodies, thrown haphazardly across their faces to save time, save space, save the living.\n\nThe old city withers."
 epidemic_events.5010.zuldazar: "At the foot of the Pyramid of Dazar'alor, an eerie silence has befallen the City of Gold. Where once the entire south seas came to give tribute, make trade, and seek the Loa's blessings now only the half-dead shamble.\n\nFrom the pyramid's terraced heights, the Zandalari nobility looks on in shame, as the city has grown to resemble the perversities of the infidel Troll kingdoms who embraced cruel Loa of blood, void, and death.\n\nA nation suffers as the Great Seal looks on in silence, holding a far greater terror at bay..."
#  epidemic_events.5010.varanasi: "It is more commonly known as the City of Light, but Varanasi has been the City of the Dead for just as long. It seems fitting, then, that it should play host to this most deadly of pestilences.\n\nIn happier times, the Ganges teems with life; now, it carries only the dead. Their bloated corpses catch on the riverbanks, kicked away by the few remaining living people who dare to venture outside.\n\nThe sounds of weeping and coughing bounce off the ancient stones of this antediluvian city."

 health.1018.t: "[SCOPE.Custom('EventTitleDisease')]: The Freezing"
 health.1018.desc: "I can't get warm. No matter how many layers I wrap around myself, the cold seeps in. My breath feels like ice in my lungs, and my skin—it's turning pale, almost blue. My fingers are going numb, stiffening, and my hands won't stop trembling.\n\nThe chill digs deeper, into my bones, freezing me from the inside. Every breath feels harder, slower. I’m freezing alive."
 health.1018.court_physician.desc: "\n\n"You seem to be affected by the frost of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DeathDeityName], my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord].""
 health.1018.a: "Make it warmer!"
 health.1019.t: "[SCOPE.Custom('EventTitleDisease')]: Rotting From Within"
 health.1019.desc: "I can feel them. Crawling. Beneath my skin, writhing like maggots. I scratch and scratch, but it doesn’t stop. My skin is sagging, turning gray, and I swear something’s moving under there. My muscles ache, like they’re rotting inside me.\n\nMy joints lock up, stiff, like I’ve been dead for days. Every inch of me reeks of decay. I can barely move, but it won’t stop—nothing stops the rot."
 health.1019.court_physician.desc: "\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], you seem to be afflicted with Crypt Fever.""
 health.1019.a: "I feel my skin rotting..."
 health.1020.t: "[SCOPE.Custom('EventTitleDisease')]: Corrupted Veins"
 health.1020.desc: "My veins burn. I can see them, dark and swollen under my skin, pulsing like they’re ready to burst. The fever is scorching, but my hands—they’re shaking, weak, covered in sores that won’t stop spreading.\n\nBlood oozes from the cracks in my skin, and every breath tastes like iron. It’s spreading fast, too fast. I can’t stop it. My blood’s turning against me, poisoning me from the inside."
 health.1020.court_physician.desc: "\n\n"I most serious malady, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. You have what is known in the more scholarly circles as Blood Plague.""
 health.1020.a: "Just do something, please!"

 health.1115.t: "[SCOPE.Custom('EventTitleDisease')]: The Warmth of the Sun"
 health.1115.desc: "I rise slowly, my breath no longer hanging in the air like smoke on a winter morning. The biting cold that had gripped my bones for days has finally loosened. My skin, once pale and numb, flushes with warmth—an unfamiliar sensation.\n\nI flex my fingers, expecting the familiar stiffness, but they obey with ease. The endless trembling has ceased, leaving my limbs blessedly still.\n\nI exhale, savoring the quiet. The chill is gone, and with it, the fear. Peace. How I'd forgotten its embrace."
 health.1115.a: "Once again I shall feel the suns embrace."
 health.1116.t: "[SCOPE.Custom('EventTitleDisease')]: Rotting No More"
 health.1116.desc: "I pull myself upright, and for the first time in days, my skin isn’t crawling with unseen vermin. The decay that had crept through my flesh has receded, leaving no more festering sores or blackened patches. My hands, once shaking and weak, are steady again.\n\nI press a hand to my chest, half-expecting the grinding pain to return, but it's gone—no more rot gnawing at my bones.\n\nI take a deep breath, the air free of that stench. Relief washes over me. Peace. I almost forgot what it felt like."
 health.1116.a: "I am free from the rot."
 health.1117.t: "[SCOPE.Custom('EventTitleDisease')]: Cleansed Veins"
 health.1117.desc: "I sit up slowly, bracing for the burning under my skin, but there’s none. The fever that had boiled my blood is gone, and my veins no longer throb with darkened sickness. I glance at my arms, expecting the usual oozing wounds, but the sores have closed, leaving only faint scars.\n\nI flex my fingers, and they move without pain—no more throbbing, no more weakness.\n\nI breathe deeply, the air free of that sour, metallic taste. I exhale, feeling lighter. Peace. How long had it eluded me?"
 health.1117.a: "The plague no longer owns my blood."
