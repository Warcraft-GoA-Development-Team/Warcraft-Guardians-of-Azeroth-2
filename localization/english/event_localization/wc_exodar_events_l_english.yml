[SCOPE.sC('marshal').GetSheHe|U] kneels before me and speaks with urgency.\n\n"I carry grave news, my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]. A shooting star has fallen from the sky and crashed into the Azuremyst Isles. The blast caused a colossal explosion that shook the earth and brightened the night. But that is not all, our scouts have informed us that that was no star at all, but a strange vessel that carried a blue-skinned race. They call themselves the draenei, and they claim to have come from another world. They say that their ship was damaged by their enemies, and crashed here by accident."\n\n"We do not yet know their true intentions. But we know that during the crash that ship released a storm of irradiated crystals that has tainted the land and turned the wildlife hostile. Those aliens claim that they are trying to contain the radiation and heal the land, but we do not yet know if we can trust them.""

They say the blast caused a massive explosion that shook the earth and lit up the starless night.\n\nSome claim that the star was merely a natural event, while others say it's the result of a great spell, cast by a powerful mage. Some halfwits even claim that it is in fact a boat that sailed the skies, carrying strange beings from another world. They say that the boat crashed and the beings emerged seeking help.

It will unleash a force that will destroy everything in its path. Our Azuremyst isles will all be gone in an instant. I do not know why or how I got this vision, but you must heed my warning, something is coming." The ramblings of the old hermit shock me, for some reason I feel they are not a deception. A comet? A cataclysm? What could it mean? I ask for more details.\n\n"I have no more details. The vision was brief and vague, I only saw the comet in the sky, the fiery ball of doom. I saw nothing else, only darkness and silence. This must be a warning from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WarGodName|U]. We have little time left, my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip].
