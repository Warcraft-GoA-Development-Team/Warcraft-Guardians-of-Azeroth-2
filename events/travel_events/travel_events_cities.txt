#These events are triggered from the Grand City Point of Interest Type.

#Loc can be reused in parts of these events therefore we will be consistent with scope naming:
#scope:city_province This is the city we are visiting
#scope:city_sight This is where the specific site inside the city is saved, as a flag.
#sightseeing_companion This is a companion relevant for the event, often the criteria depends on the chosen site. Companions are not required but influence options.

#Events save the memory memory_big_city_visited which is also used to block the events from firing again in the same location

#Scripted trigger is checked for all city events
scripted_trigger city_event_check = {
	current_travel_plan.travel_plan_owner = root
	is_playable_character = yes #Landed, house head in an administrative realm, or an adventurer camp owner.
