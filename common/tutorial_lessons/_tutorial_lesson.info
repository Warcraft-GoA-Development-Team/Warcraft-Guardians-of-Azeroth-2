	start_automatically = yes/no	# Does the lesson start automatically if the trigger is fulfilled? Use the start_tutorial_lesson effect to manually start such lessons on user actions. Default: yes
	trigger = { ... }		# The trigger has to be true for the lesson to start.

	gui_tag = X				# When any of this lesson's step is active, the specified tag is set and can be detected by IsTutorialTagOpen('X') in gui. There can be multiple gui_tag properties.
	highlight_widget = X	# When any of this lesson's step is active, the specified GUI widget will be highlighted. The widget's name should be unique for the functionality to work properly.
	trigger_transition = { ... }	# This trigger transition can happen whenever any of the lesson steps are active. There can be multiple trigger transitions. See the lesson step trigger transition documentation.

	delay = X				# The lesson start will be delayed by that many seconds.
	default_lesson_step_delay = X	# The default delay for the lesson steps of this lesson.

	finish_gamestate_tutorial = yes/no		# Disables the "railroaded" tutorial mode when the lesson is done. See save_progress_in_gamestate in tutorial chains. Default: no

	shown_in_encyclopedia = yes/no 		# Is this lesson shown in the enyclopedia. Default: yes
	
	lesson_step_1 = { # arbitrary name
		text = X				# The localization key of the text shown for this lesson.
		
		# A button transition, there can be multiple transitions. The player has to click the corresponding button for it to happen.
		gui_transition = {
			button_id = X		# Arbitrary string used to determine which button the transition is attached to. Look for usages of "Tutorial.HasTransition" etc in the tutorial_window GUI script. The "next" ID is used to show instructions to the player (see enabled below).
			button_text = X		# The localization key of the text shown on the button.
			target = ...		# See target in trigger_transition above
			enabled = { ... }	# Optional trigger to disable the button. The trigger description of the button with button_id "next" (define TUTORIAL_STEP_INSTRUCTION_BUTTON_ID) will be shown in the tutorial window as instructions.
		}
		# Triggered transition, will proceed automatically when the trigger is fulfilled. Can have an optional dummy button to show instructions to the player.
		trigger_transition = {
			trigger = { ... }	# The transition will happen when this trigger is evaluated to true.
			# target can be on of:
			target = X			# Name of the step to tranistion to
					lesson_finish		# Finishes the leson
					lesson_abort		# Aborts the lesson
			button_id = X		# Optional. See gui_transition above. If present, will show a disabled button, and possibly show instructions to the player. Since the transition is automatic, the player will never actually click on the button.
			button_text = X		# Ignored if no button_id. See gui_transition above.
		}
		# The difference between a trigger_transition with a button_id and a gui_transition with an enabled trigger is that the trigger_transition
		# will proceed automatically when the condition is fulfilled, while the gui_transition will enable the button when the condition is
		# fulfilled and wait for the player to click on the button.
