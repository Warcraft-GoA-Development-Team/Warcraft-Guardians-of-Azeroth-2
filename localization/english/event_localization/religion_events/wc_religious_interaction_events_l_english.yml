 # Religious Head of Faith Interactions
 wc_religious_interaction.1010:0 "After much deliberation, I have undertaken to repent for my wrongdoings. The Inquisition's decision to mark me as a heretic was entirely correct.\n\nI humbly ask that this history will not outshine my future actions as a follower of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName]. If the Inquisition, by the grace of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName], decided to grant me the Light's mercy, I would be most grateful."
 wc_religious_interaction.1010.accept:0 "Very well, [actor.GetName], we accept your surrender."
 wc_religious_interaction.1010.refuse:0 "You are not yet worthy of redemption, [actor.GetName]..."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011:0 "We have received your letter, [actor.GetTitledFirstName]. The Inquisition is grateful for your willing surrender. Agents are already on their way to take you into custody, and you are expected to cooperate with them to the best of your ability.\n\nKnow that this will not spare you from the rigors of true penance, but your choice not to flee or fight the Inquisition may win you the trust of some."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.cynical:0 "Let's get this over with."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.zealous:0 "Do your worst, inquisitors, faith is my strength."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.deceitful:0 "I knew it would come to this, I am prepared."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.arrogant:0 "Your inquisitors cannot break me."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.normal:0 "I know that I am innocent, as will they."
 wc_religious_interaction.1012:0 "We have received your letter, [actor.GetTitledFirstName]. The Inquisition has chosen not to accept your surrender. Spoken plainly, your accused crimes are too great to allow surrender on your own terms. We expect that this repentant attitude continues when true justice finds you."
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.deceitful:0 "They must suspect a trap."
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.paranoid:0 "They don't want a confession, they want my head!"
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.zealous:0 "May [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName] forgive them!"
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.cynical:0 "One meaningless gesture for another."
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.arrogant:0 "Their forgiveness means nothing to me anyway."
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.normal:0 "Perhaps they've bigger concerns than me..."

 wc_religious_interaction.1020:0 "Several of your peers have found your faith and morals lacking. [actor.GetTitledFirstName] has personally attested to your many failings, and I fear that I cannot let them go unpunished."
 wc_religious_interaction.1021:0 "You are suspected of betraying the tenets of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]. For too long your actions have gone unnoticed, but this ends today. You must stand trial before the [actor.GetFaith.ReligiousHeadTitleName] or be branded a heretic. May [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName] have mercy on your soul... For we will not."
 wc_religious_interaction.1022:0 "[actor.GetTitledFirstName], your reports of [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] heresies concern me. To think that such villainy could occur under my watch is sickening, and I have deemed it necessary to place the Scarlet Mark upon [secondary_recipient.GetHerHim|l], branding him an enemy to [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]."
 wc_religious_interaction.1023:0 "The mission of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate] is most righteous, and demands its followers to be equally so. It is every [actor.GetFaith.GetAdherentNameNoTooltip] duty to look upon his fellows, to ensure their loyalty and faith and to call out whoever errs.\n\nHowever, your request to have [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstName] with the Scarlet Mark has been denied. Whatever guilt you see in [secondary_recipient.GetHerHim|l], the Inquisition has not found. I would advise you to be more careful with your accusations, lest the conclave begin to suspect you to be hiding secrets yourself."
 wc_religious_interaction.1024:0 "[recipient.GetTitledFirstName], you bear the Scarlet Mark, branding you a convicted heretic. The failings which brought about your branding have not been forgiven, but we believe that they can be redeemed.\n\nThe time you spent Marked has clearly been punishment enough. I have therefore deemed your Scarlet Mark to be removed. From this time forward, you may rejoin the ranks of the Faithful."
 wc_religious_interaction.1110:0 "Your prisoner, [recipient.GetFirstName], has arrived safely and we are most delighted that you've sent [recipient.GetHerHim|l] to repent with our guidance. The Inquisition recognizes devoted followers of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate] like yourself, and will reward you appropriately."
 wc_religious_interaction.1110.zealous:0 "It was my duty to bring [recipient.GetHerHim|l] to justice."
 wc_religious_interaction.1110.vengeful:0 "This is only the beginning of [recipient.GetHerHis|l] suffering..."
 wc_religious_interaction.1110.sadistic:0 "Would that I could make [recipient.GetHerHim|l] suffer myself."
 wc_religious_interaction.1110.normal:0 "For [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]!"
 wc_religious_interaction.1115:0 "Your vile presence has corrupted my dungeons for far too long. My faith has given me wisdom and strength, and with the counsel of the [actor.GetFaith.PriestNeuterPlural] I have decided to send you to the Inquisition.\n\nThis does not absolve you of your crimes completely, as you will now be at the mercy of [inquisitor.GetName]..."
