=== Structure ===

== Hierarchy ==

Titles are defined from top to bottom in the hierarchy.
Each level is optional.
The prefix specifies the title tier.

e_my_empire = {
	k_my_kingdom = {
		d_my_duchy = {
			c_my_county = {
				b_my_barony = {
				}
			}
		}
	}
	c_my_other_county = {}
}

== Properties ==

(This is very incomplete!)

k_my_title = {
	# Special creation requirements.
	# root: the character trying to create the title
	can_create = {}
	# Used instead of can_create when we consider creating the title during partition succession.
	# root: the character for whom we're executing succession (_not_ the new holder).
	can_create_on_partition = {}
	can_be_named_after_dynasty = no # Won't get named after its holder's dynasty for holders who'd otherwise apply such naming

	cultural_names = {
		X = Y	# X is a name of a culture. If the title is held by somebody with culture X, the title name will use the Y localization key and the adjective will use Y_adj
	}
}
