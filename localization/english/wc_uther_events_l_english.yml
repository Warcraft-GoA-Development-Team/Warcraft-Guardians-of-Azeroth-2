 uther_events.001.d:0 "By the light!\n\nCrisis has befallen Lordaeron. Prince Arthas has returned from Northrend, consumed by madness. He has slain his own father and now seeks to bring destruction to Lordaeron and beyond.\n\nHow could this happen? I was his mentor, it was my duty to instill in him the virtues of the Silver Hand. Even when he crossed the line and purged the innocent at Stratholme, he still sought to protect the kingdom. All rulers must make difficult decisions to protect their people. But now, I must make my own.\n\nMy fellow paladins have gathered, and now I am to lead them in destroying the undead Scourge. But with Arthas at it's helm, that will mean killing him..."
 uther_events.001.a:0 "No, I cannot. I shall discard my hammer, forever."
 uther_events.001.b:0 "Damn it, I will put you down, Arthas."
 uther_events.001.c:0 "Lordaeron must be protected at any cost."
 uther_tooltip:0 "You will try and convince [GetGlobalVariable('arthas_character').Char.GetFirstName] otherwise, or abandon the investigation."
 uther_win_tooltip:0 "You convince him successfully."
 uther_lose_tooltip:0 "You fail to convince him."
 uther_stay_tooltip:0 "You will stay in the investigation party."
 uther_events.002.t:0 "The Culling"
 uther_events.002.d:0 "I nearly shudder when I hear the words come out of Arthas' mouth? #italic Purge?#! Who are we to sacrifice the innocents of Stratholme in pursuit of eradicating this plague?\n\nSurely this does not coincide with what I have been teaching him, and to kill is not a task that should be taken so lightly. Surely, there must be another way to save Stratholme. I must contemplate what the best course of action is from here, and quickly."
 uther_events.002.a:0 "I cannot watch you do this, [GetGlobalVariable('arthas_character').Char.GetFirstName]!"
 uther_events.002.b:0 "Maybe I can convince him otherwise..."
 uther_events.003.t:0 "The Fate of Stratholme"
 uther_events.003.d:0 "Fortunately, I have succeeded in convincing Arthas there is another way to proceed with Strathlome. But now, the real battle begins. We must devise another way to save the city, as its citizens are in dire need of our help.\n\nWe should..."
 uther_events.003.a:0 "...Quarantine the city instead."
 uther_events.003.b:0 "...Evacuate everyone."
 uther_events.003.c:0 "...do whatever [GetGlobalVariable('arthas_character').Char.GetFirstName] wants."
 uther_events.035.d:0 "Rejoice!\n\n[GetGlobalVariable('arthas_character').Char.GetTitledFirstName] has decided on another plan. We will be trying something less... #italic extreme#!.\n\nBecause of [uther.GetName],"
 uther_events.035.d_q:0 " we will be attempting the quarantine the city instead. This will be a more gentle approach to the situation, albeit we will have quite the problem on our hand if it fails."
 uther_events.035.d_e:0 " the city will be evacuated. We must be careful to identify sick citizens, so they do not spread the plague. This method will be risky, but it is better than them being dead..."
 uther_events.035.a:0 "Thank the light! He was brought to his senses."
 uther_events.035.b:0 "Why did he even consider that?"
 uther_events.004.d_betrayal:0 "To my surprise, Arthas has gone behind my back, and decided to purge Strathlome once again! I can't believe he's done this.\n\n"
 uther_events.004.d:0 "[GetGlobalVariable('arthas_character').Char.GetFirstName] has gone mad! My attempts to convince [GetGlobalVariable('arthas_character').Char.GetHerHim] have failed, and now others must suffer for my lacking. I do not believe I can continue to mentor [GetGlobalVariable('arthas_character').Char.GetFirstName]  in this condition.\n\nThis day will be ever remembered as a grave historic trauma for my cherished Kingdom of Lordaeron. Innocents will die at [GetGlobalVariable('arthas_character').Char.GetFirstNamePossessive] hand, and I cannot stop him. May they and the $HighGodNameAlternate$ forgive me."
 uther_events.004.a:0 "He cannot be saved."
 uther_events.004.b:0 "I must take a more drastic approach."
 uther_events.004.c:0 "There is nothing I can do..."
