The Cult of the Damned is strong enough to take a more forward approach and more importantly begin setting the stage for an outbreak of the Plague of Undeath. You must still be vigilant since a misstep at this point could prove costly for your plans.\n\nYou order your loyal cultists to begin discretely infecting certain grain silos near the distribution centers of the [plague_center.GetName]. If all goes according to plan, it is only a matter of time before the whole county will be plagued by the undead."

The infected grain stored in the silos in the [plague_center.GetName] has been distributed all across the county unbeknownst to [target.GetTitledFirstName]. Soon, chaos ensued as the dead rose and started to overpower the local garrison.\n\nThe county is scrambling for defenses against their own countrymen and more importantly, they have been unable to stop the spreading of the plague to neighboring counties. Soon, all shall serve your will!\n\n"
