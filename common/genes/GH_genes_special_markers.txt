# This file describes marker decal genes for various portrait effects, such as statues, shades and the like.
#
# Decals applied by these genes have no visual effect by themselves (they consist of only fully transparent diffuse textures),
# however they contain reserved values in their pixels at a certain mip level (specified by GH_MARKER_MIP_LEVEL shader constant),
# which are detected and interpreted by shader code in portrait_decals.fxh to dynamically apply corresponding effects to the character's portrait.
