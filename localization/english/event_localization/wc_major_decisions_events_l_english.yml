Their warriors have massacred the innocent wherever they may be found, including the houses of [founder.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate].\n\nThe [abbot.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of $c_northshire$ has pleaded with me to allow his clerics and their followers to take up weapons and train for war. To accept could set a dangerous precedent, and may lead to a future war with the Church.\n\nStill, I have no choice. The [invader.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTooltip] bear down on us and threaten to eradicate my people. This new fighting force will be known as the [leader.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseName]."

Their warriors have massacred the innocent wherever they may be found, including the houses of [founder.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate].\n\nI have beseeched the [founder.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip|l] to allow my priests to join the fight, not just as healers, but as bearers of weaponry and spells of smiting. Without these, they will be cut down by the savage [invader.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTooltip], leading only to further death.\n\nKnowing this, the [founder.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip|l] has wisely granted me this request, even allowing our flock to equip themselves for war. Still, should we win, $c_northshire$ will wield signifcantly more influence in the [founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip|l]."

The [abbot.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of $c_northshire$ has called upon them to take up arms and study the once-forbidden spells, the destructive magic of smiting.\n\nFollowing them are bands of fanatical pilgrims, peasants no longer content to aid the war through menial labor. Our [founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip|l] shall now incorporate this new warband into our army."

Their wounds are healed by the clerics that lead them, and their weak forms are bolstered by holy blessings."
