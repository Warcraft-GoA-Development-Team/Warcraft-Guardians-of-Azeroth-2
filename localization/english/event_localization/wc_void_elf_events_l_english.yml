 void_elf.0100.desc:0 "\"Nether flux readings stable, all outputs within tolerances...\" Your assistant looks up at you with admiration, \"We've done it, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName].\"\n\nYears of work have paid off, and the culmination of thousands of years of Elven research is at hand. Thanks to the miraculous technology of this Cosmic Observatory, worlds beyond Azeroth will no longer be hidden from sight and the secrets of the Twisting Nether are now within reach. Elven understanding of the universe will reach new heights; a bounty of esoteric knowledge reserved only for the [wc_elder_races|E] and the most trusted mortals.\n\nOver the din of polite applause and scientific discussion, beneath the pleasant popping of magic-fortified wine bottle corks, a sonic pattern emerges in the monitoring crystals. The chatter of your subordinates and retainers seems to fade a little as your mind struggles to make sense of the thrum. Is it... A voice?\n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]?\" Your assistant waves his hand in front of your eyes, \"You've been standing there for over an hour. Is something wrong?\""

 void_elf.0110.desc:0 "The cosmic observatory hums with quiet activity as your assistants move to and fro amongst the arcane instruments of the Cosmic Observatory, yet to your perception they are as distant as the nether planes they study.\n\nYou are focused on the most sensitive instrument, a resonator that is attuned to the sonic vibrations of the deepest parts of the cosmos. Between realms, in the dark interstices where no energy swirls and beyond the influence of the spheres, in a place where nothing but silence should be, a voice calls out to you and you alone.\n\n#italic [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]... Come find me...#! \n\nThe voice is intense with the seductive power of the Void, the madness-inducing spell of the Old Gods; but there is something underneath. A kindness long buried, a desperation, the self-hatred of a corrupted soul. A longing overtakes you... You need to find her. You need to save her."

 void_elf.0120.t:0 "Whispers From The Void: Katabasis"
 void_elf.0120.desc:0 "From the moment you stepped into the worlds beyond, you knew nothing would be the same. Causality works here in unpredictable ways, cause and effect are blended and distorted like a waking dream, all sense of time is lost in a world without day or night and no pattern amongst the stars or changing seasons. Each moment passes as a lifetime, traveling across some bizarre and non-euclidean plane. The eldritch logic of this place penetrates your soul, and you begin to discern a divinity within this alien world.\n\nStill, from deep in the farthest reaches of this extradimensional interstice, the voice you heard many lifetimes ago on Azeroth continues to call. You hear its ardence, you feel its sorrow, you sense its power. You are aware, through an inexplicable connection to this being, that it was once a manifestations of all that was good and noble in every living thing. Now it is twisted and warped by the same influences that constantly threaten to tear veneer of sanity from your soul. Can such a being be tamed? Can such a being... be purified?"
 void_elf.0120.a:0 "This journey must continue... She must be saved."
 void_elf.0120.a.consequence:0 "You will teach your people a new way of living, freeing them from dependency on the Elven wells of mana."

 void_elf.0130.t:0 "Whispers From The Void: Anabasis"
 void_elf.0130.desc:0 "After subjective millennia, you finally reached her: the Void Naaru Ru'oro. You barely even remember her visage, her fractal mien shattered your perception even worse than the twisted acausal logic of the worlds beyond. In a dreamlike state, self-hypnotized against the constant whispers of the Old Gods, you performed a ritual to ensnare Ru'oro and drain her incalculable power temporarily. Your stupor extended a hundred lifetimes as you led her back to a crevice in the twisting nether adjacent to Azeroth, your near-forgotten home. Only after all this was it finally time to return.\n\nWhat stepped out of the nether a mere matter of months after entering the Worlds Beyond was nearly unrecognizable to your colleagues. Aged thousands of years; brushed with the alabaster, obsidian, and amethyst hues of Nether Energy; crackling with unbridled power, your stunned courtiers and assistants listened as you imparted the knowledge you had gleaned... A new way for the Elven people."
 void_elf.0130.a:0 "And they shall be known as #italic Ren'dorei#!"

#\n\nUshering them into the safe alcove in the void, you taught them to siphon void energy from Ru'oro, infinitesimally purifying the cursed being and infusing their elven bodies with void power. In exghange, all that is asked is an unwavering commitment to the defense of Azeroth from the nightmares you experienced in the Worlds Beyond.
