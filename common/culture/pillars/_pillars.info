The following pillars are cultural traits with the functionality outlined in _cultural_traits.info:
- Ethos
- Heritage
- Language
- Martial custom

The base structure is identical to cultural traits in general with following added field:
type = ethos/heritage/language/martial
color = scripted_color/direct_color # Only for languages
audio_parameter = <key> # Only for heritages

If no description is set and no description matching the entry key exists then will use <type>_generic_label_desc as the key
