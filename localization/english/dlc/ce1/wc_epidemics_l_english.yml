 # SS Note - Future updates should only include cities of cultures with Life Expectancy category 2 or less. 
 epidemic_events.5010.stormwind: "Precious few feet now fall on the bridge over the Valley of Heroes. Only the hardiest and most fervent still walk the path towards the plague-stricken city, seeking salvation from the Holy Light even as they themselves succumb to the loathsome sickness.\n\nThe beautiful trade district, so often filled with cheer and good-natured barter, is the refuge of the damned. The Cathedral bells ring mournfully over streets deaf to all but the cries of the afflicted. Putrid bodies float in the canals and loll obliviously against the piers.\n\nThe dead and the dying rattle their last here, pitifully alone."
 epidemic_events.5010.orgrimmar: "The roaring rapids of the Southfury River carry more than just flotsam and traders now. Bloated, sun-bleached corpses are deposited downriver, their agonised faces set in a silent rictus grin, popped buboes livid against the pale skin.\n\nThe solid walls, so many times a guardian against incursion from the living, are now buttressed with the dead. The twisting, narrow streets have become a maze of stacked corpses, rats using the piles as both refuge and sustenance.\n\nWill our people's hard-won unity survive this curse?"
 epidemic_events.5010.lordaeron: "What a tragedy has befallen humankind's greatest city!\n\nCountless souls have walked these venerable roads, but the ranks of the dead swell more swiftly day by day. The scourge sweeps the streets, blighting every pretty plaza and glorious archway. The old marbles stand silently, helpless against the torture of the living. The dying rattle their last, on their lips the words scarcely dared thought of in better times:\n\n"Has the Light forsaken the heirs of Arathor?""
 epidemic_events.5010.boralus: "The gentle tides of Tiragarde Sound happily against the piers of Boralus Harbor, belying the catastrophe on the land.\n\nThe sick shamble hopelessly between ramshackle buildings. Where bakers once hawked their wares lie piles of dead, the living unable to keep up with the tide of sickness constricting the city.\n\nThe scene would nearly be peaceful, were it not for the groans and coughs of the dying."
 epidemic_events.5010.gilneas: "The city of mists, ever dark and dour, is now a tapestry of death.\n\nThe canals are choked with bloated corpses cast hastily aside, suffusing the fog with a miasma of decay. Eldritch chants are heard in the alleys— fragments of long-forgotten prayers spoken in hushed tones as the superstitious and desperate return to the Old Ways.\n\nThe grim and stoic Gilnean people cling to precious life in their homes, sequestered around candles and jealously guarded hoards of precious supplies. Even their great walls and moats could not save them from the invisible threat of disease."
 epidemic_events.5010.thunder_bluff: "The marketplaces and trading squares of the city, so usually bustling with activity, have fallen deathly silent. The proud bridges between the mesa rises are clogged with the sick, the dead cast down in piles for the vultures to feast on below.\n\nThe Elder Rise overlooks the carnage sadly, the ancestral spirits unable to stop so deadly and silent a killer as the dreaded pestilence.\n\nThe City of the Four Spires dies slowly, those vaunted stone pillars unable to keep the sky from falling."
 epidemic_events.5010.ironforge: "What city is more known for its steel than Ironforge? The magma floes feeding the Great Forge have been used to quench the blades of a million swords, but there are some threats no amount of fine craftsmanship can protect from.\n\nIt is a grim irony that the quarreling clans should be so suddenly united in the face of such adversity. The sickness kills without prejudice, laying low all from every walk of life.\n\nThe ancient smithies fall silent. Those who worked them turn their calloused hands to prayer rather than toil, in hope that the divine may save them where a weapon would not."
 epidemic_events.5010.stromgarde: "Ancient beyond measure, Stromgarde has watched the successor lordships of the Arathi Basin rise and fall, yet still it stands strong. It has endured much, but it will need to endure further still.\n\nThe wind that soothed the heart of Thoradin himself today carries death with it as it blows. The malignant dead are carried away by masked soldiers and cast off the ancient parapets into the sea, but more and yet more replace them. The cliffsides are strewn with bodies, thrown haphazardly across their faces to save time, save space, save the living.\n\nThe old city withers."
 epidemic_events.5010.zuldazar: "At the foot of the Pyramid of Dazar'alor, an eerie silence has befallen the City of Gold. Where once the entire south seas came to give tribute, make trade, and seek the Loa's blessings now only the half-dead shamble.\n\nFrom the pyramid's terraced heights, the Zandalari nobility looks on in shame, as the city has grown to resemble the perversities of the infidel Troll kingdoms who embraced cruel Loa of blood, void, and death.\n\nA nation suffers as the Great Seal looks on in silence, holding a far greater terror at bay..."
#  epidemic_events.5010.varanasi: "It is more commonly known as the City of Light, but Varanasi has been the City of the Dead for just as long. It seems fitting, then, that it should play host to this most deadly of pestilences.\n\nIn happier times, the Ganges teems with life; now, it carries only the dead. Their bloated corpses catch on the riverbanks, kicked away by the few remaining living people who dare to venture outside.\n\nThe sounds of weeping and coughing bounce off the ancient stones of this antediluvian city."
