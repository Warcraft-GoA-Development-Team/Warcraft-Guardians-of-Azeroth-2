The Dark Portal, a rift between the worlds of Azeroth and Draenor, has been opened in the Black Marsh east to the unsuspecting kingdom. Through it came the Orcish Horde, eager to claim Azeroth for its own.\nThe Horde's ambitious warchief, Blackhand, is preparing for a glorious campaign to add a second world to his path of glory. Minorities such as noble chieftain Durotan's Frostwolf clan refuse to follow Blackhand's destructive way and only wish to flee their dying world. Whatever their motivation might be, it changes nothing for king Llane and the humans of Stormwind who will fight to the death to defend their homeland.\nIt is not only a story of kings and warchiefs, though, for unknown to sides, war is a game of chess between sorcerers' masterminds and their secret agenda. The human Medivh and the orc Gul'dan opened the Dark Portal for reasons of their own, and they are not done, yet."

The Alliance is weakened by political and economical crises. Quel'Thalas and other kingdoms distanced themselves from Lordaeron to pursue their own isolated destinies; remnants of the Horde and rebels are still fighting on, while a mysterious epidemic appears in Lordaeron's Eastweald. Rumors spread around the kingdom of a mad prophet's warning to flee an incoming doom and the necessity to flee to the west. Still, prince Arthas Menethil intends to fight on and safeguard his people and his future realm.\nElsewhere, in the arctic continent of Northrend, contact has been lost with all human settlements and colonies. The powerful local empires of the Nerubians and Drakkari Trolls once so mighty are retreating from a new rising power, the Lich King. This mysterious being raises undead armies and prepares for war against the living. Few can oppose him in the north and he might have plans for the rest of the world, too."
 start_year_605_06_06_desc:0 "The apocalyptic Third War has come to an end and with it the Burning Legion's reign of chaos. The demon-lord Archimonde has been destroyed and the demonic invasion repelled, Azeroth was saved. Now, in the aftermath of the war, the night elves are rebuilding their wounded civilization in Kalimdor, not far from their new neighbors exiled from the Eastern Kingdoms. Both humans and orcs settled in the continent to found their respective realms of Theramore and Durotar. To the east, Lordaeron is now dominated by the undead and ruled over by its new king, Arthas, in the name of the Lich King.\nThe world is not yet at peace; however, for the Lich King is weakened and the Legion does not wish his treason to stay unpunished. The remaining dreadlords fight to keep control over the Scourge, while the fallen night elf Illidan Stormrage has been recruited by Kil'Jaeden to destroy the Frozen Throne itself. The fate of the Scourge is set and the Frozen Throne is the prize, a prize that may change the face and the fate of Azeroth forever."
