 legend_chapter_opening_priesthood_restoration: "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetNameNoTooltip|U] entered this world as the [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'faith' ).Faith.GetAdjectiveNoTooltip] faithful were shattered across the world in a hopeless diaspora.

Every [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'faith' ).Faith.GetReligion.GetAdherentNameNoTooltip|U] wandered the land with the name "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]" on their lips, telling tales of countless holy happenings in [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] name."
 legend_chapter_extra_deed_religious: "However, that was not the end of the tale, for the faithful were still harassed by bandits and evildoers, and enslaved by heretics! [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip|U] helped those living under tyranny to raise themselves into the embrace of [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'faith' ).Faith.HighGodName|U], triumphing over [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'faith' ).Faith.DevilName] and [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'faith' ).Faith.DevilHerHis] minions."
 legend_chapter_conclusion_priesthood_restored: "The priests were gathered and the diaspora brought to an end.

 legend_chronicle_motivation_exotic_backstory: "[ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip|U] beheld [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] new home and wept, for its technologies and culture were so primitive compared to the wonders [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetSheHe] had grown accustom to in [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'location' ).GetFlagName]. The work was clear: [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] must spread the enlightenment of [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] homeland to this corner of creation."
 legend_chronicle_conclusion_exotic_backstory: "Much had changed since [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] had arrived. Where once peasants rolled around in squalor and barbarians bled the land dry, [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] had spread the light of civilization. Though there were many rocks in [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHis] path, he collected them all as means to build a new realm to rival [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'location' ).GetFlagName]. All across the realm, babes are named for [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and the masses sing out in grateful chorus for the stranger from [ROOT.Legend.GetProperty( 'location' ).GetFlagName] who built their great city."

 legend_chronicle_divine_intervention_motivation: "[Localize( god )|U] spoke to [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] in the plane of dreaming and charged [ROOT.Legend.GetProtagonist.GetHerHim] with a holy mission.
