# Hidden Stress Framework Events
#	stress_threshold.0001 — Fired when character crosses a stress threshold. Checks if a Mental Break event can be fired and, if yes, does so.
#	stress_threshold.0002 — As above, but for characters in prison (they get events from a different pool, for obvious reasons).
#	stress_threshold.0005 — Fired 5 (or 8, with a perk) years from the last Mental Break a character received. Re-fires either 0001 or 0002, as appropriate.
#	stress_threshold.0010 — Sends a toast to players when they gain a Stress Level.
#	stress_threshold.0400 — Fired when a character reaches 400 Stress. Resets the normal 5-year cooldown for Mental Breaks and immediately fires ones.
#

#	stress_threshold.1721 — Impostor Syndrome: clearly you just aren't good enough for your rank!
#	stress_threshold.1731 — No Time for Myself: your limited time to yourself is intruded on.
#
# Level 2 Mental Breaks
#	stress_threshold.2001 —	Ingratitude [Generic]: Annoyed with lack of appreciation.

#	stress_threshold.3411 —	I am Unworthy: your impostor syndrome has become a full-blown complex.
#	stress_threshold.3421 —	Domain of Debauchery: your holdings burn, but you're too ensconsed in hiding from your stress to care.
