This documentation is rather scant. Sorry.

== Structure ==
my_relation = {
	opinion = 42			# Opinion the owner of the relation has towards the target
	special_guest = yes		# If the relation target is in the same court, this will be shown specially in the court list (e.g. "Harold's Ward"); default: no
	title_grant_target = yes 	# They might get given titles if they're unlanded and their liege or above has this relation towards them
	relation_aliases = { friend } # If you for example use random_relation_friend other relations specifying friend as an alias will also be a valid relation.
	hidden = yes			# Relation is not shown to the player
}


== On-actions ==
Each scripted relation has several associated on-actions:
- root = the relation owner ("source" of the relation)
- scope:target = the relation target
on_set_relation_x = { }		# Has just been added. Not triggered if the relation is added because it is corresponding to another relation.
on_remove_relation_x = { }	# Has just been removed & before the corresponding relation is removed
on_death_relation_x = { }	# When the owner of the relation is about to die

These will fire when the relation is set or removed via script.

For example, you could do:
on_set_relation_lover = {
	events = {
		debug.0001
	}
}
The initiator is ROOT, the other character is scope:target.
For two-way relations, the on-action only fires on the initiator. Including if the corresponding relation is a different one (E.G., mentor vs. student)


== Opinion Modifier ==

opinion_modifier = {
	opinion = 30
}

The impact the relation gives on the owning character's opinion of the relation target.


== Modifiers ==

modifier = {
	monthly_prestige = 1
}

A modifier applied to all characters with the relation. (This means that applying it two a two-sided relation will give both characters the modifier.)




== Random Skills ==

"Random" based on owner id, target id and relation entry index so two people adding each other in the same relation will produce the same pattern of random skills

random_skills = {
	value = 2
	trigger = {
		is_ai = no
	}
}

== Fertility ==

A multiplier against their fertility, used in place of the PRIMARY_SPOUSE_FERTILITY_MULTIPLIER etc defines

fertility = 1.25

== Flags ==

Relations support up to 16 simple flags. They have to be defined as a numerical entry in the relation itself. Note that these are effectively simple bool checks, and cannot be timed.

0 = first_flag
1 = second_flag


In script:

add_relation_flag = {
	flag = first_flag
	target = scope:target
	relation = relation_type
}

remove_relation_flag follows the same syntax.
