The sweet symphony of their screams still echoes in my ears, a prelude to the next movement of our grand opus. The time has come to bring the [GetTitleByKey('k_quelthalas').GetName] to its knees.\n\n"Commander," I call out, my voice resonating with dark authority. In my peripheral, I see the shambling corpse of a figure wearing the armour of Lordaeron, once a soldier or a captain, moving toward me. "Prepare our forces. We march to Silvermoon."\n\nOur goal is the [GetTitleByKey('c_sunwell_plateau').GetNameNoTier], the font of unimaginable power that will cement our dominion. The High Elves, with their arrogance and their radiance, will know despair. Their light will be snuffed out, replaced by the eternal darkness we bring. I relish the thought of their golden spires crumbling, their forests burning, and their people bowing before the inevitable tide of death. The Sunwell shall be ours, and with it, the Scourge will be able to bring back the Necromancer from the dead. The High Elves believe themselves safe behind their ancient wards and powerful magics, but they will learn that no barrier can withstand the will of the [GetTrait('lich_king').GetName(GetNullCharacter)]."
