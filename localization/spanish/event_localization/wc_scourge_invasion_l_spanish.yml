 WCCSC_5_TITLE:0 "Frozen Throne"
 WCCSC_5_DESC:0 "Darkness has fallen upon Northrend this day, as a mass of unearthly ice has descended from the heavens to bury itself deep within Icecrown Glacier. Those who beheld it with their own eyes have named it the Frozen Throne, for the great spire looms over all and casts a dread shadow over its new domain.\n\nFrantic tales of creatures losing their minds to madness and of the dead rising as bloodthirsty monsters have quickly spread through your realm, inciting panic and despair. A terrible blight has gripped the roof of the world, and it falls to you to protect your people from this unholy scourge."
 WCCSC_5_OPT_A_death:0 "All are equal in death."
 WCCSC_5_OPT_A_legion:0 "This is your last chance, [nerzhul.GetFirstName]. Serve, or be destroyed."
 WCCSC_5_OPT_A_evil:0 "Death has come into play at last..."
 WCCSC_5_OPT_A_neutral:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName|U] save us all!"

 WCCSC_15_TITLE:0 "Jailors of the Damned"
 WCCSC_15_DESC:0 ""Did you think yourself shrewd enough to get rid of us, orc?" [scourge_jailor.GetFirstName] asked. A hint of snark was in [scourge_jailor.GetHerHis] voice as [scourge_jailor.GetHerHis] fiery eyes gazed on you. You felt angered, even powerless.\n\nYou'd tried to get rid of one of [scourge_jailor.GetHerHis] brothers, perhaps in a foolish bid to escape the gilded cage in which the Legion trapped you. Perhaps you should've stuck with doing what you were told to do, but there you were: powerless. As the demonic being smashed the Frozen Throne to bits, you pondered what could have been if you had succeeded."
 RULKAN_OPT:0 "Rulkan, my love, I'm coming..."

 WCCSC_20_DESC:0 "Perched atop Icecrown, where even the Light dared not show itself, you stared at the great snowy land of Northrend, pondering as your undying hordes of minions carried out your command ever so dutifully.\n\nSuddenly, a soft whisper was carried by the cold wind. A dreadlord with a smug smirk on [scourge_jailor.GetHerHis] face stood there in front of your undead being, [scourge_jailor.GetHerHis] fiery eyes piercing through your icy cage: "There remains little time, [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFirstName]. Five measly years is all you've left to fulfill your role." [scourge_jailor.GetSheHe] said, seemingly enjoying the thought of what [scourge_jailor.GetSheHe]'d do to you were you ever to fail to live up to the Legion's expectations."
 WCCSC_20_OPT_A:0 "My part will be done, [scourge_jailor.GetFirstName]."

 WCCSC_25_DESC:0 ""Would you care to beg, orc? I do so enjoy your kind asking for mercy when their doom is inevitable."\n\nThe dreadlord was drunk on his own power and your despair. Towering over you, [scourge_jailor.GetSheHe] kept reminding you of your failure to dispose of [scourge_jailor.GetHerHim] and [scourge_jailor.GetHerHis] brothers so you wouldn't have to suffer [scourge_jailor.GetHerHis] snarky attitude. You had failed. Failed to dispose of Kil'jaeden's sycophants, even failed to merely bring the Legion back to Azeroth.\n\nThere you were, powerless, as the demonic being broke your ice shell. For a brief moment, your thoughts flew to Rulkan and Draenor before the watchdog crushed your helm to bits, leaving only dust scattered across the cold wasteland."

 WCCSC_30_DESC:0 "At long last, freedom! After so many years shackled to the will of your demonic masters, you stand free of all burden after having disposed of those pesky dreadlords acting as your jailors. The gall of Kil'jaeden, to think that such weak sycophants would be good enough watchdogs to ensure your compliance. Humorous images crossed your mind as you imagined his anger once he realized what you have accomplished.\n\nNow free to rule over your unending hordes of undead subjects without the Legion nipping at your heels, the world shudders as icy winds coming from Icecrown whisper of your name and commands."
 LONG_LIVE_THE_KING_OPT:0 "Long live the [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('QueenKing')]!"
