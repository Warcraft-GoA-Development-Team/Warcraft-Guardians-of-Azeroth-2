 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_antioch: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier]: seat of the Pentarch, evangelized by Saint Peter himself, where Christianity moved its first official steps. Once a thriving city of faith and commerce, it has been hit hard by centuries of border attrition, so that it is now only a shadow of its former glory.\n\nNevertheless, a glorious shadow can be brought back to greatness by a strong guiding hand, like mine!"
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_antioch_not_christ: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier]: once a thriving city of faith and commerce and a proud capital of Christianity, lost and regained by the faithful many times, it has been hit hard by centuries of border attrition, so that it is now only a shadow of its former glory.\n\nNevertheless, a glorious shadow can be brought back to greatness by a strong guiding hand, like mine!"
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_jerusalem: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier], the Holy City, has finally returned to the caring hands of the True Emperor, rightful representative of our Lord on Earth.\n\nThe Pentarch Seat shall soon be restored, and throngs of pilgrims will be able to visit Christianity's birthplace safely again, under the protection of Roman arms."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_jerusalem_not_christ: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier], the Holy City of three religions. Many coveted it but, since the early days of the Empire, it has only had one legitimate ruler: the Emperor.\n\nAs we ensure its safety and peace again, we can look forward to receiving throngs of pilgrims from all corners of the Empire and beyond!"
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_alexandria: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier], the gem of Egypt, is back in Roman hands! Seat of the Pentarch, millennia-old capital of culture, once among the most active centers of Christian philosophical and theological debate, ruined and abandoned by the greedy clutches of the infidels.\n\nOnce again shall the city of Alexander rise together with the true Empire!"
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_alexandria_not_christ: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier], the gem of Egypt, is back in Roman hands!\n\nOnce the seat of all world's knowledge and wisdom, it has been hit hard by Christian persecutions, to the point that little remains of its past glory. Little, but not nothing, and with this understanding we shall rebuild a city worthy of its past!"
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_frontier: "\n\nNowadays, the locals call this area [county.GetNameNoTier]. Albeit shortly, Romans walked these shores when Emperor [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '145279' ).GetFirstName] led his valiant legions deep into Mesopotamia.\n\nThis was once the final frontier of our Empire to the East, and so is it again today."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_edessa: "\n\nThe famous city of [county.GetNameNoTier] — among the earliest centers of Christian evangelization, seat of an Ecumenical Council, stage to the martyrdom of many glorious Saints — has been contested between the Empire and its invading neighbors for many centuries.\n\nOnce again, it is now returned to the care of the rightful Emperor, and this time it will be for good, may [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] be willing."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_edessa_not_christ: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier]: once the capital of the Province of Osroene, this city stood proudly as the barrier separating Romans and Sassanids for 400 years before falling to the advance of Islam.\n\nCenturies have passed since that time, and [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] has been contested between the Empire and our neighbors throughout. May this glorious day of conquest be the last the city shall see!"
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_bari: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier] has always been an important harbor on the Mediterranean but hardly a strategic stronghold — until the Arabs came.\n\nTheir invasion made it painfully clear that, in order to ensure the safety of both Southern Italy and the Balkans from conquest, we need a strong and defendible foothold in Italy. Now that [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] is again in our hands, we shall strive to use it as the linchpin of our Western defense."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_syracuse: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier]: trade port, center of Christian evangelization in the West, and Western capital of Emperor Constans II.\n\nWhat was once the last Roman stronghold against the Muslim conquest of Sicily has fallen too, but it has now been restored! Glory and riches await the conqueror, and a new step has been taken towards the restoration of the legitimate Empire."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_rome: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier]. The Immortal City. First capital and birthplace of our Empire.\n\nWhile the imperial authority has long abandoned this land for Constantinople — the New Rome, and the local astray Pentarch has unlawfully filled the subsequent void of power, the redelivery of the City to the one and righful Emperor is reason to rejoice. New greatness awaits the Empire now that we have taken such a monumental step to the West."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_ravenna: "\n\n[county.GetNameNoTier] was the seat of the last Emperors when a legitimate Emperor still sat on the throne in the chaotic West ravaged by barbarians. Therefore, it was natural for Emperor Justinian I to place the center of the re-established Roman administration there.\n\nCenturies have passed since the Longobards pushed the last Romans out of Northern Italy; however, a new age of peace, prosperity, and unity has just begun."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_carthago: "\n\nNowadays, the main settlement of the area is [county.GetNameNoTier], but we have not forgotten the time when the Romans controlled these shores from Carthago — once a lethal enemy, later a prosperous city of faith and culture, now an empty husk of its previous greatness.\n\nWhile it might be too late to restore the city to its former glory, the convenient position of this area will certainly prove vital to the restoration of the Roman presence in Africa."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_tingis: "\n\nNowadays, the locals call this city [county.GetNameNoTier], but we knew it as Tingis, capital of the province of Mauritania Tingitania.\n\nOnce a thriving center of Roman power, the city has been lost to us and to the Light of the True Faith for centuries, after the hordes of the Vandals sent to punish our corruption swept onto it first, followed by the Muslim Caliphate. Luckily for them, the long age of barbarian domination is over, and the Imperial Peace has been re-established."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_carthago_spartaria: "\n\nNowadays, the locals call this area [county.GetNameNoTier]. Justinian I, however, named it Carthago Spartaria and made it one of the main centers of the re-established Roman presence in the West.\n\nCenturies have passed since the city fell into barbarian hands for the latest time; however, as our control is reinstated in Iberia, the glory of Justinian seems within reach once again."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_milan: "\n\nOur ancestors named this area [county.GetNameNoTier] from the barbarians who first subtracted it from the Empire, the Longobards. One of its main centers, Mediolanum, was the capital of the Western Part of the Empire under the Tetrarchs, and Constantine the Great issued the Edict granting religious freedom to the whole Empire from this same city.\n\nWhile the Longobards moved their capital away, the area is still prosperous and will make for an excellent stronghold in Northern Italy."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_trier: "\n\nNowadays, the locals call this city [county.GetNameNoTier], but we still remember how our people used to call it: Augusta Treverorum, seat of the tetrarch Constantius Chlorus, father of the founder of our New Rome, Constantine the Great.\n\nGermanic invaders have long overtaken it, more recently even fashioning themselves as "Emperors", abusing a title that does not belong to barbarians. It matters no more. As my loyal troops reconquer what once was ours by right, all pretenders will be annihilated, and only one legitimate Empire shall remain."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_hadrians_wall: "\n\nThe barbarians who occupied this area after the last Roman Eagle departed have called it [county.GetNameNoTier]. Once, the mightly Wall of Emperor Hadrian was enough to keep the barbarians outside the Empire, and these very lands were the final frontier of civilization northward.\n\nNow the Wall lies in ruins, and barbarians have spread throughout the land for centuries. But no more. Today, Hadrian's frontier stands again!"
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_chandax: "\n\nThe Arabs who first conquered Crete moved their capital to ancient Heraklion and called it [county.GetNameNoTier], while the original capital, Gortyna, declined.\n\nRe-gaining control of the new heart of the island is a fundamental step to ensure security in the Mediterranean and prosperity for the whole Empire, as traders and pirates alike can now be stopped and readdressed, and invading fleets can be intercepted."
 ep3_emperor_yearly.2000.desc_tours: "\n\nNowadays, the locals call this area [county.GetNameNoTier], from the now-forgotten Latin name of its main settlement, Civitas Turonum. In the last days of the Western Part of the Empire, the city was a true metropolis, dominating the whole Province of Lugdunum.\n\nSince then, its importance has only partially diminished, as Christian pilgrims still flock to it on their way to Santiago, and it has acted as a bulwark against two invasions: that of the Arabs, and that of Vikings. True Roman spirit still lingers in these lands, and they will rediscover it whether they like it or not!"
