#For a character with a "high" ai value (see above), the product of ai_value * modifier_scripted_value should be:
#High =  400
#Medium = 200
#Low = 100
#Tiny = 50

#Example: high positive ai value is 40. As high should return the product 400, the high_chance_impact_positive_ai_value should be 10.

# old ai values #
#################
#Base:
#max: having the top 3 personality traits
#high: having the top 1 (not 100)
#medium: having the top 2nd highest (or slightly higher if traits with this ai value is common)
#low: 10/15/20 (depending on how common it is, this level should be quite common)


#todo_cd: Come back and adjust these numbers once the ai_values are set and balanced (last adjusted as above 2017-11-27). Questions: is this a good system? Should more than 4 personality traits be included? Should lifestyle and physical traits be included?
