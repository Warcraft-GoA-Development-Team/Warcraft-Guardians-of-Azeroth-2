# 1001 - 1099: Reclamation of Lordaeron Events
##############################################

 forsaken.1000.title:0 "Undercity Construction Begins"
 forsaken.1000.desc:0 "My vassal has begun construction of a vast fortress in the sewers beneath the ruins of Lordaeron, known as the Undercity. My councilors assure me that this will secure the position of the Forsaken in the region forever. However, I must also contend with the fact that this impregnable position becomes theirs to control and not my own. Perhaps it would be a wise decision to reimburse them for the costs and gain some control over the construction of this monumental task."
 forsaken.1000.opt.a:0 "It is time to assert our control."
 forsaken.1000.manage_construction_title:0 "Liege Assumes Control"
 forsaken.1000.manage_construction_tt:0 "Liege has reimbursed construction costs and assumed control over construction of the Undercity."
 forsaken.1000.opt.b:0 "There is no need, they seem capable enough."
 forsaken.1000.approve_title:0 "Top Liege Approves"
 forsaken.1000.approve_tt:0 "Undercity construction has Liege approval."
 forsaken.1000.opt.c:0 "How dare they start this project without my permission!"
 forsaken.1000.disapprove_title:0 "Top Liege Does Not Approve"
 forsaken.1000.disapprove_tt:0 "Undercity construction resulted in rebuke from Liege."

 forsaken.1001.desc.owned:0 "The elevator lurches, and for a moment I am startled, but as the descent begins I quickly regain my composure. My engineers assure me these devices work to a high tolerance, but the effect is no less jarring as machines of this size are uncommon in the scourged wasteland that was once Lordaeron.\n\nAs the elevator descends, a dazzling sight begins to open up to me- a vast city beneath a city; bustling with soldiers, traders, magic users, and of course my growing cadre of government officials. The sewer's vaulted tunnels have been fortified with iron gates and stone reinforcements. Abominations and Forsaken warriors with their menacing crossbows stand guard. [GetGlobalVariable('sylvanas_character').Char.Custom2('GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveOrMy', ROOT.Char)] dream has been realized... From this underground fortress the Forsaken shall never be dislodged!\n\nAs the descent nears its end, I prepare a few words to the gathered throng of Forsaken and allies. Rumors gathered by my [spymaster] and [court_chaplains] tell of hidden knowledge unearthed in the ruins, which has so far escaped our oversight. Our top agents are tracking down this literature at this moment to gague its usefulness to the realm. For now, I must push these thoughts from my mind as I prepare to inagurate this great edifice of our burgeoning culture.\n\nThe elevator slows to a stop..."
 forsaken.1001.desc.independent:0 "My spies report that the current holder of Lordaeron City has completed my project: The fortification of the Undercity. It will now make them much more difficult to dislodge should we attampt to retake the city again either by force or intrigue. What's worse, my agents report rumors of hidden knowledge unearthed in the ruins. As the standard bearer for our culture, it is probable that I will be faced with the consequences of this outcome."
 forsaken.1001.opt.a.owned:0 "This is a momentous day for the Forsaken!"
 forsaken.1001.opt.a.independent:0 "My life's work turned against me..."
 forsaken.1001.tooltip.a:0 "#X We will find out in time if there is any truth to the rumors of hidden knowledge rediscovered in the sewers...#!"

 forsaken.1002.title:0 "A Dream Deferred"
 forsaken.1002.desc:0 "Our efforts to secure the Undercity have come to an end, as we have lost our control over the capital city. Perhaps in a number of years we may be able to try again once we have reconquered this territory which is ours by right, but for now it seems the dream of a home beneath the ruins of Lordaeron is outside our reach."
 forsaken.1002.opt.a:0 "This disaster will not go unavenged!"
 forsaken.1002.tooltip.a:0 "You or another of your culture will be able to build the Undercity again in 5 years."

 forsaken.1003.title:0 "A Legacy to Carry On"
 forsaken.1003.desc:0 "Even as we mourn the recent loss of our leader, work continues on the Undercity project. It now falls to me to ensure the construction is a success and deal with any consequences. Work proceeds apace, but we must be vigilant to hold the territory of Lordaeron City until the work is completed and our kind can keep it permanently in the grasp of its rightful defenders."
 forsaken.1003.opt.a:0 "Glory to the Forsaken!"

 forsaken.1004.title:0 "The Undercity Rebuilt"
 forsaken.1004.desc.vassal:0 "Deep within the bowels of the Ruins of Lordaeron City, the gearshafts of a massive elevator begin to rumble as a crowd gathers alongside me. Beneath fortified portcullises and reinforced stone vaulting we stand in wait for [GetGlobalVariable('sylvanas_character').Char.GetTitledFirstName] to inspect the work we have done here.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName]," whispers my [spymaster] discreetly, "Our agents continue to pursue the rumors of forbidden mystical works discovered amongst the ruined tunnels earlier this year. It would not be wise to alert our... guest... to these goings on, lest we be held accountable for not securing them ourselves."\n\nI nod in approval, disguising my gesture as a greeting to one of the more notable individuals in attendance, and the [spymaster] slips away into the crowd. Every precaution has been made to ensure that this inauguration ceremony goes smoothly, every invitee thoroughly vetted. As the figure of the [GetGlobalVariable('sylvanas_character').Char.GetTitle] comes into view, I lead a cheer from the crowd..."

 forsaken.1100.title:0 "$forgotten_shadow$: The Selinite Revival"
 forsaken.1100.desc:0 "And so, the other shoe has dropped. Throughout the construction of the Undercity, rumors abounded of hidden knowledge discovered deep within the sewer system. Our inquisitors, agents, and [court_chaplains] have uncovered cells of hidden crypto-religionists following the so-called $forgotten_shadow$. These teachings originated with Natalie Seline, a priestess of Stormwind during the Orcish Invasion who heretically invoked her acolytes to embrace and understand the Shadow as well as the $LIGHT_NAME$. Thusly labeled Selinites, these priests were an effective if unorthodox tool in the ultimately futile fight against the Horde.\n\n Now, with her writings given new context in the wake of the [scourge|E] invasion and occupation of Lordaeron, our people who have embraced this nascent religion have taken to calling themselves $forgotten_shadow_adherent_plural$. Now, my councillors implore me to find a way to proceed regarding this new development..."

forsaken.9001.desc.echoseeker:0 "Our archivists caught a suspicious individual leaving our library sanctum with classified magical grimoires and rare scrolls. Apparently the individual is one of a small sect of liberated undead who seek to regain the "$echo_of_life$" through Arcane magic. Known as "$echo_of_life_adherent_plural$"", these individuals are not known to proselytize actively but often engage in risky and dangerous magical practices. However, as this individual stands before me I can see no hint of malice; rather a pitiful and desperate individual begging for mercy and a second chance.\n\nOn one hand, I can deal justice to this individual as I see fit since they are a convicted thief. On the other, they might make a useful courtier or a potent spy if I can tolerate their pitiful beliefs."

As this individual stands before me I can not ignore a hint of malice behind the glimmering intellect of a crafty and talented alchemist.\n\nOn one hand, I can deal justice as I see fit to this convicted thief.
