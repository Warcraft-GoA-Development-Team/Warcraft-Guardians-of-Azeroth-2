 EVTTITLE_isolation_2:0 "Uldum Unveiled"
 EVTDESC_isolation_2:0 "In the southern wastes of Kalimdor, a major stir has occurred near Thistleshrub lands. The locals of Tanaris have recorded the appearance of a majestic, ornate gate leading to lands unknown. Some of the farraki elders have heard stories and rumours of a long-forgotten kingdom, populated by titan worshippers and filled to the brim with their artifacts, possibly even a weapon that is capable of raining destruction on a large scale, although no one was able to confirm that until now. Numerous explorers already storm the gate, hoping to study or perhaps even sell the artifacts to the highest bidder, while the locals remain wary of the outsiders disturbing the millennia-old status quo, especially with the qiraji temple city looming over the horizon. One thing is certain - Uldum will never be the same again with the shroud gone."
 ISOLATION_2_OPT_A:0 "Now where's that superweapon that everyone's talking about?"
 ISOLATION_2_OPT_B:0 "We shall see what these outsiders bring to Uldum."
 ISOLATION_2_OPT_C:0 "Fortune and glory, here I come."
 EVTTITLE_isolation_4:0 "The Mists of Pandaria"
 EVTDESC_isolation_4_pandaria:0 "his morning, a messenger brought you astounding news. A number of lighthouse keepers have noticed strange boats coming out of the fog. One of the ships was wrecked, but the rest managed to find a way out of the mists.\n\nHow could these boats have found a way in and out of Pandaria's mists? Could it mean that the mists have parted?\n\nThe wrecked ship's crew is not like any other race we know. They speak about kingdoms and lands beyond the sea. If their stories are true, the world is much bigger and more dangerous than we believed. We must be prepared to face more ships and wanderers soon."
 EVTDESC_isolation_4_azeroth:0 "This morning, a messenger brought you astounding news. A group of boats fishing in the South Seas has stumbled upon an uncharted land. One of the ships was wrecked, but the rest managed to find a way out of the mists.\n\nAll ships were aware of the importance of avoiding those waters due to dense fog and old fables, but it looks like the mists have parted.\n\nThe fishermen even tell that they have seen towers of gold far on the horizon. If their stories are true, they could have discovered a new land inhabited by sentient beings directly south of the Maelstrom. We should send expeditions there to learn more."
 ISOLATION_4_OPT_A:0 "New lands to explore and conquer."
 ISOLATION_4_OPT_B:0 "Welcome, wanderers!"
 ISOLATION_4_OPT_C:0 "Send an expedition, I want to know more."
