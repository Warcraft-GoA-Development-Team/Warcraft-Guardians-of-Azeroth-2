# DESIGN NOTE ON MANDATE EVENTS
# Mandate events should be structured in script following a specific option format in order to sync them with the UX presented to the player, and scripted proportionally in a certain fashion for the same reason.
#
# The option format for _every_ mandate event should be:
## Resolve the situation at a cost to yourself for the benefit of your liege
### Option #1 allows this using one of the positive traits associated with that mandate - this replaces the possible skill duel
### Option #2 allows this using a skill duel against one of the skills associated with that mandate
## Resolve the situation and split the benefit between yourself and your liege
### Option #3 is always a straight skill duel, using the same skill as Option #2
## Abandon the situation
### Option #4 allows this using one of the negative traits associated with that mandate - this replaces the regular opt out
### Option #5 is a regular opt out
#
# The ratio is for which skills are used in these events. Every mandate has a primary skill and two secondary skills, and the primary skill should be the one most used in the events. The ratio to aim for is 3:1:1 for primary skill:secondary skill A:secondary skill B.
