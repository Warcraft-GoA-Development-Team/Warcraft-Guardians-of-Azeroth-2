Allowed Modifiers
=================

Modifiers referenced by a terrain object can be only generic (hardcoded) modifiers, or modifiers generated from the following databases:
- schemes
- holdings
- lifestyles
- regions

Other generated modifiers are _not_ allowed, such as those from other terrains, men_at_arms_types, cultures, or governments.

Generated Modifiers
===================

Each terrain type adds this modifiers automatically:

KEY + _attrition_mult = 0 			# Multiplier applied to attition of the terrain terrain type
KEY + _cancel_negative_supply = yes	# Discards supply penalties from the terrain type
KEY + _advantage = 0				# Advantage during the combat
KEY + _development_growth = 0.2		# Development growth if capital of a county is this terrain
KEY + _development_growth_factor = 0.2		# Development growth factor if capital of a county is this terrain
KEY + _construction_gold_cost = 0.2
KEY + _holding_construction_gold_cost = 0.2
KEY + _construction_piety_cost = 0.2
KEY + _holding_construction_piety_cost = 0.2
KEY + _construction_prestige_cost = 0.2
KEY + _holding_construction_prestige_cost = 0.2
KEY + _supply_limit = 200
KEY + _supply_limit_mult = 0.2
KEY + _tax_mult = 0.2
KEY + _levy_size = 0.2
