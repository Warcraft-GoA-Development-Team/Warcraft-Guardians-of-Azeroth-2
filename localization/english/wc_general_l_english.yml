 martial_strategy.2001.Serpents_Spine.desc:0 "#F Countless battles have been fought near the Serpent's Spine. Every hundred years the mantid swarms attack the wall. The strong survive, the weak die. Thus, defeat only strengthens the swarm. Their enemies, the mogu have created a variety of defensive combat tactics to counter the never-ending mantid. The mogu knew that information is the key to victory. A network of signal lights was placed on the wall. A message about an attack could reach the other end of the continent in a couple of hours.#!"
 martial_strategy.2001.Suramar_Pass.desc:0 "#F The scrolls describe the Battle of Suramar Pass. King Magnar's warriors launched a massive attack on Stormheim, surprising the highborne with their ferocity. Magnar led the charge, his shield was protecting him from the elves' arcane magic. The vrykul scored immediate victories and built enough momentum to push the highborne out of the city entirely. The highborne's last chance to reclaim the city happened at Nightborne Pass. They rallied their forces for a final counterattack and clashed with the vrykul in a brutal, confined brawl, but the vrykul eventually achieved victory.#!"
 martial_strategy.2001.Alterac.desc:0 "#F The Battle of Alterac is a turning point in the history of the Eastern Kingdoms. The armies of Quel'Thalas and Arathor engaged the trolls in a great battle. The battle lasted for many days, but the knights of Arathor refused to give any ground. Eventually, the elven masters agreed that it was time to unleash the elven and human mages upon the trolls. Magical fires from the sky hindered the trolls' regeneration, and their morale suffered. After some hours of magical bombardment, the remaining human and elven warriors charged the trolls, broke their lines, and forced them into a terrible rout. Even as they fled, the trolls were pursued and butchered by the merciless allied forces.#!"
 martial_strategy.2001.Mennar.desc:0 "#F The Battle of Mennar is one of the many fights of the War of the Ancients. Instead of regrouping outside the city to join in the counter-assault, the mages of Mennar stayed behind, erecting magical barriers and turning their once-quiet home into a fortress. Refugees streamed to the Mennar Academy in the first terrible days of the invasion, and survivors rallied to mount a defense. For all their bravery, the mages were unable to withstand the countless legions of demons, yet their heroism breathed hope into the hearts of the peoples of Azeroth.#!"
