 WCBEI_10_DESC_start:0 "They told me the news and I no longer knew what to do with myself. My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('lost_character'))] [lost_character.GetFirstName] died but was brought back to our world by unholy magic.\n\n"
 WCBEI_10_DESC_protect:0 "I'm sorry, [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('lost_character'))], I couldn't protect you."

 WCBEI_10_DESC_child:0 "The adults didn't say much about what that means. Will I never see [lost_character.GetHerHim] again?"

 WCBEI_100_TITLE:0 "Twisting Nether"
 WCBEI_100_DESC:0 "I have lost my body in the mortal planes but my soul has found its way to the Twisting Nether.\n\nThousands of twisted demonic souls, merging into a single stream, chasing grains of cosmic energy. Only the strongest may survive, the rest meet oblivion.\n\nI can join the stream, feeding on magic and regain my mortal shell or give up and dive into the Great Dark Beyond."

 WCBEI_100_OPT_A:0 "I will return!"
 WCBEI_100_OPT_B:0 "Finally I can rest..."

 WCBEI_110_DESC:0 "Time goes differently in the Twisting Nether. I have lost track of whether it has been decades or centuries.\n\nI have been wandering in the Great Dark Beyond, lurking for magic and my way back to Azeroth. Finally, I have found it.\n\nBy sheer force of will, I materialize back in the mortal plane in my formal body."

 WCBEI_110_OPT_A:0 "I have returned!"
