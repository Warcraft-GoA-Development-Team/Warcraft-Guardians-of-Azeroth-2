# A lot of on_actions are called from code when different things happen in-game. (Hence the name)
	# TODO_CD: Decide if you want to request a list of every code on-action. This is doable, but will take a few hours of code time. Could be done after RC since editing this file is risk-free. Would certainly be handy for modders

# A few on_actions are called from code, but at specific intervals rather than as a response to in-game occurrences
	# List:
		- yearly_global_pulse 		# Called every January 1st. Does not have any scopes attached to itself (i.e. there doesn't exist a root)
		
		- on_yearly_playable 	# Called from code once a year for "playable" (count and above) characters. # Root is the character. The date it fires is based on their birthday, so different characters will have it fire on different days of the year, but it will fire on that date every year.
		
		- three_year_playable_pulse 	# Same as on_yearly_playable, but only every three years.
		
		- five_year_playable_pulse 		# Same, but every five years
		
		- quarterly_playable_pulse 		# Same as on_yearly_playable, but fires every quarter. Comes with a saved scope value called "scope:quarter", which has a value from 1-4, denoting which quarter it is. Can be checked as for example "scope:quarter = 2". Note that this is relative to the on_yearly_playable pulse, and not calendar quarters.
		
		- random_yearly_playable_pulse 		# Fires randomly at some random point during the year for all playable (count+) characters.

		- random_yearly_everyone_pulse 		# Fires for all characters at a random point during the year. Playable characters will have both this and the random_yearly_playable_pulse over the course of the year.

		- five_year_everyone_pulse 		# Fires every five years for all characters.

		- three_year_pool_pulse 	# Fires every three years for pool characters.



# Beyond this, on_actions can also be fired from script by using the trigger_event effect:
	trigger_event = {
		on_action = on_action_name
		days/months/years = X  	# Optional
	}

		delay = { days = 365 }		# A delay will mean that all events listed after it will only be fired after the delay has passed. NOTE: For performance reasons, an event will only successfully fire if it is valid both when the on_action is executed AND once the delay is complete. All firing entries support delays, whether for events or on_actions.

		200 = event_id_2
		100 = 0		# Having a "0" entry means that there is a chance no event fires, even if there are other valid events. Good for making sure that rare events don't always fire just because every other possible event is invalid.

	effect = { 	# An on_action can run effects. It can access the same default or saved scopes as the script chain/code functionality it was fired from. Note that it happens concurrently to events triggered by the on_action, NOT before. Effects run here create a separate chain than events the on_action fires, so you can for example not manipulate values in the effect, and then reliably access those in an event that was fired at the same time. Scopes or local variables set in the effect here will not carry over to any event fired by the on_action.

	fallback = another_on_action 	# on_actions can define a fallback on_action. If no events/on_actions are run by the on_action, the fallback gets called instead. Avoid creating infinite fallback loops, or the game may be prevented from advancing time!
}

=== MODDING INFO ===

# You can declare data for on-actions in multiple files, however, you cannot have multiple triggers or effect blocks for a given named on-action. In particular, you cannot append an effect block directly to an on_action which already has an effect block, as this creates a conflict. 

# If a modder wishes to append their own effects to an on_action without overriding a file, they may do it as follows:

some_vanilla_on_action = {
	on_actions = {some_modded_on_action}
}
some_modded_on_action = {
	effect = {
		some_fun_modding_effect = yes
	}
}

# This makes the vanilla on-action call the modded on-action whenever it fires.
