### Terenas Funeral
 lordaeron.2001.t:0 "Death of our King"
 lordaeron.2001.d:0 "A sombre atmosphere envelops Lordaeron as [terenas.GetNamePossessive] funeral pyre is lit.\n\nWhispers spread amongst those gathered at the scene, statements of shock and tales of past glory. A grim silence is felt as we watch [terenas.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] body begin to burn. The fire dances and swirls, casting an orange glow that reflects in the tearful eyes of those gathered. As the intensity of the blaze grows, a plume of smoke rises skyward, carrying with it the remnants of the departed.\n\nTo be slain by your own son, your bloodline, is a fate none wish to match. Each crackle of the bonfire represents a step he took — a problem he faced — in helping us to thrive in this great country of ours. Even in our darkest days, in this current plague, he never faltered. The loss of this Kingdom's just leader will never be forgotten."
