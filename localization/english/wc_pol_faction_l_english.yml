 WCPLF_100_DESC_alliance:1 "Calling themselves the $union_alliance_name$, they welcome all noble nations of Azeroth who are struggling to weather the storm and preserve their cultures and peace. Driven by tradition, they respect deep commitments to abstract concepts such as nobility, honor, faith, justice, and sacrifice. Striving to represent these high ideals, they declare their willingness to contribute their technical, arcane, and spiritual wisdom toward the shared goal of preserving order on Azeroth and creating a peaceful and just world."
 WCPLF_100_DESC_horde:1 "Calling themselves the $union_horde_name$, they welcome all disparate nations that are struggling to survive in this hostile world that would see them destroyed. Driven by unity, they are bonded together as a family, comrades, or even uneasy allies. Focused, ferocious, and sometimes monstrous, the $union_horde_name$ values strength and honor and is ready to push back those that threaten their ideals and seek to shatter the status quo."
 WCPLF_100_DESC_custom:1 "Calling themselves the $union_custom_name$, they welcome close nations that share their cultural values and religious practices. Led by the $UN_CUSTOM_LEADER_TITLE$, they preach that their unique traditions will endure only if they stay together and keep outsiders away.\n\nIf anyone dares cross the $union_custom_name$, they will feel their combined might and zealous fury of $UN_CUSTOM_LEADER_GODS$."
 WCPLF_100_DESC_illidari_forces:1 "Calling themselves the $union_illidari_forces_name$, they stand united in their pursuit of power. Comprising those who have dared to embrace the fel, they share a common goal: eradicating the threat that plagues Azeroth. Bound by their willingness to wield dark magics and make unthinkable sacrifices, they are a force to be reckoned with. Fueled by a burning desire for retribution, they harness their formidable powers to face the relentless darkness and forge a future free from the Legion's tyranny."
 WCPLF_100_DESC_dragon_forces:1 "Calling themselves the $union_dragon_forces_name$, dragons are ancient and powerful beings that have watched over Azeroth since time immemorial. Each aligned with a unique aspect of the world, they wield immense elemental powers. Committed to safeguarding the delicate balance of the world, they value wisdom, knowledge, and the preservation of natural order above all else. With the ability to shape-shift and manipulate the very fabric of reality, they stand as formidable protectors of Azeroth, ready to face any threat that endangers the world they hold dear."
 WCPLF_100_DESC_scourge_forces:1 "Calling themselves the $union_scourge_forces_name$, they are a relentless army of undead, bound by the will of the Lich King. Driven by a singular purpose—to spread death and decay—they seek to consume all life in Azeroth. Devoid of morality or compassion, they are the embodiment of darkness and despair. Raised from the remains of the fallen, they serve as the vanguard of the Lich King's unholy dominion. With necromantic powers at their command, they march forth to extinguish the light and plunge the world into eternal darkness."
 WCPLF_100_DESC_axis_of_awful:1 "Calling themselves the $union_axis_of_awful_name$, this malevolent coalition comprises the most sinister forces in Azeroth. United by their insatiable thirst for power and conquest, they seek to spread chaos and darkness across the realm. Disregarding notions of honor and virtue, they revel in treachery, deceit, and the pursuit of their own nefarious agendas. Masters of forbidden magics and unholy rituals, they are a formidable threat to all that stands in their way. With malevolence in their hearts, they sow discord and mayhem, aiming to subjugate Azeroth under their cruel dominion."
