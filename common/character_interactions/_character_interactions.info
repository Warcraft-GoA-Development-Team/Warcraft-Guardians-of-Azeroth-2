=== FAQ ===
Q:	What does the special interaction type arrange_marriage_interaction do?
A:	special_interaction = arrange_marriage_interaction will add extra marriage info to the interaction
	this info makes the game show the special marriage interfaces when setting up an interaction or replying to it.
	It's also used by the ai in knowing which interaction to use when setting up marriages.
	It automatically marries/betroths the secondary participants and sets up alliances and hands out prestige.
	
Q:	What does "secondary_actor = marriage" and "secondary_recipient = marriage" do?
A:	It states that the interaction has secondary participants (the one's actually getting married) and that
	we're allowed to change them in the interface. It also automatically redirects the interaction to the matchmaker
	so that the player can arrange a marriage with the son/daughter of another ruler and get the child as the
	secondary recipient and the ruler as the recipient (since they will be the ones accepting or not).
	It also sets up the list of characters to choose from from the actor/recipient with their courts and children.
	
Q:	What does "secondary_actor = marry_off" and "secondary_recipient = marry_off" do?
A:	Very similar to marriage, but with some expections:
	- The list of characters is calculated from all living characters that are allowed to marry.
	- The redirection makes the character you do the interaction with the secondary actor (since you're the one marrying them off)
	- There's the marriage redirection for whoever you select them to marry (ie mostly being the employer)

Q:	How and when are the character interaction triggers checked?
A:	These are the main triggers used by interactions:
	- is_shown
	- is_highlighted
	- is_valid_showing_failures_only
	- is_valid
	- has_valid_target_showing_failures_only
	- has_valid_target
	- can_be_picked
	- can_be_picked_title
	- can_be_blocked
	- can_send

Q:	What are the possible types for target_filter?
A:	Possible types:
	- actor_domain_titles
	- recipient_domain_titles
	- secondary_actor_domain_titles
	- secondary_recipient_domain_titles
	- actor_domain_titles_including_leases
	- recipient_domain_titles_including_leases
	- secondary_actor_domain_titles_including_leases
	- secondary_recipient_domain_titles_including_leases
	- actor_de_jure_titles
	- recipient_de_jure_titles
	- secondary_actor_de_jure_titles
	- secondary_recipient_de_jure_titles
	- none (default) 

Is there any other special behaviors set in code that these interactions are affected by?
When are the following conditions evaluated, are any of them checked during special circumstances (e.g. "not all scopes exist yet"):
is_shown
can_be_picked
is_valid_showing_failures_only
has_valid_target_showing_failures_only

Q:	How and when are the character interaction triggers checked?
A:	These are the main checks used by interactions:
	
	Can Send: If an interaction can be sent is tested like this:
		- check if set up for sending (this means that all targets and secondary actors/recipients that the interaction uses, must have been selected)
		- check diplomatic range (if interaction scripted to use it)
		- make special is shown checks decided by special_interaction =
		- Trigger: is_shown
		- check if the interaction is already being considered by the recipient
		- Trigger: is_valid_showing_failures_only
		- Trigger: has_valid_target_showing_failures_only
		- Trigger: can_send
		- Trigger: is_valid
		- Trigger: has_valid_target
		- make special can send checks decided by special_interaction =
		If it passes all the above, then we check if the interaction needs to be accepted (auto_accept = no or failing trigger and interactions that can be sent regardless like imprison)
		interactions that need acceptance cannot be sent to the ai unless it will accept.
	
	When populating a list of titles we look at this (examples: grant title, revoke title):
		- select domain or dejure title based on target_filter =
		- Trigger: can_be_picked_title with the full interaction scope and the title set as scope:target
		Note: can_be_picked_title is not checked when we try to send, it's a separate trigger that should be a fast way of deciding what can end up in the list to select from
		
	When populating a list of characters we look a this:
		- secondary_actor/secondary_recipient = decides what to base the list off (vassals, courtiers, marriage, dynasty, house, ...)
		If we're haven't picked a character already (many interactions wants us to pick two characters, such as marriage)
			- Trigger: can_be_picked with the current interaction scipe and the tested character set as root	
		Else if we're picking character number two
			- Try setting the character as secondary_actor/secondary_recipient. The interaction should be fully set up after this.
			- Do a full Can Send test, but ignore the ai acceptance check.
		Note: can_be_picked is only there to filter out the first character we need to select and is not part of the Can Send test.
		
	Is Shown: is_shown is used by the interface to check if the interaction should be visible in the interaction list
	Is Valid: is_valid and is_valid_showing_failures_only are tested to see if an interaction should be enabled (clickable) or not in the menu
