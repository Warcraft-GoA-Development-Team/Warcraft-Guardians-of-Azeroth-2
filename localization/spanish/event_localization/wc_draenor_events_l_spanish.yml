 WCDRA_5_TITLE:0 "The Dark Portal"

 WCDRA_3_DESC:0 "Your army has reached the Dark Portal. After the long siege, your troops have occupied the surrounding area and are now awaiting your orders.\n\nFel energy forms in the portal's center, creating a window into the other world. Enemies can step through at any moment, so you must make a decision quickly: put an end to this accursed gateway once and for all or claim it for yourself."
 WCDRA_3_OPT_A:0 "We must close it, now!"
 WCDRA_3_OPT_B:0 "Our two worlds will stay connected."

 WCDRA_5_DESC:0 "All the world trembles in the wake of this momentous day: the Dark Portal has been destroyed.\n\nBy bringing the best and the brightest of [portal_destroyer.GetFullNamePossessive] spellcasters to bear, the great stone gateway that served as a bridge between Azeroth and Draenor was torn asunder and obliterated to nothing more than a pile of rubble and an ominous rift; a tear in the fabric of space and time itself. As the dark energies of the portal exploded outward, the Black Morass - already corrupted by the Portal's influence - has been scorched into an arid waste of dead earth that many are now beginning to call the Blasted Lands. No one is sure whether this damage is irreversible or if the land might someday be healed, and many magical masters are concerned by what further damage the rift might cause.\n\nAn even greater mystery, however, is what fate yet has in store for the people of Draenor who were caught on either side of the portal during its destruction. Those on Azeroth must now carve their own path in life and find a place in this world as best as they can, while those left behind on Draenor will be doomed to die a slow and painful death alongside their world, assuming nobody stabilizes the rift and reopens the portal...\n\n[portal_destroyer.GetFullNameNicknamed] will do what they can to ensure that doesn't happen, of course, but what can be done if there yet remains someone with the power and will to open it from the other side?"
 WCDRA_5_OPT_A:0 "We can never return home again..."
 WCDRA_5_OPT_B:0 "What a waste..."
 WCDRA_5_OPT_C:0 "And may it never open again!"

 WCDRA_100_DESC:0 "Your guards bring you a [refugee.Custom('WomanManGirlBoy')]. They say that [refugee.GetSheHe] and [refugee.GetHerHis] group were caught by a patrol near the [refugee.Custom('GetDarkPortalRift')]. It would appear that they somehow got to the [refugee.Custom('GetPortalRift')] and crossed it, all without being noticed by guards on either side of the gateway.\n\nWhen you ask the fugitive, [refugee.GetSheHe] calls [refugee.GetHerselfHimself] [refugee.GetFirstName] and tells you [refugee.GetSheHe] had no other option but to sneak through the [refugee.Custom('GetPortalRift')]."

 WCDRA_100_DESC_village:0 "The soil of Draenor has lost its fertility, so [refugee.GetHerHis] village, left behind by the Horde, is starving. Those who still can walk decided to come to the other side to find a better place.\n\n"
 WCDRA_100_DESC_ending:0 "Draenor is dying. [refugee.GetSheHe|U] begs you: allow [refugee.GetHerHim] to stay or at least let [refugee.GetHerHis] people go free."

 WCDRA_25_DESC:0 "The skies darkened overhead, punctuated by violent storms. The land itself shuddered in response to the pulsing, unholy magic rooted within the swampy ruins of the Black Morass. Magical tendrils expanded and retracted from the site of the old Dark Portal that was closed many years ago.\n\n[portal_reopener.GetFullNameNicknamed] has opened the gateway tethering the world of Azeroth and the realm of Draenor once more. That same conduit that first gave entry to Azeroth from the shattered realm of Draenor many years ago. Brace yourselves, the world is in peril once again!"

 WCDRA_1000_DESC_portal:0 "[portal_owner.GetTitledFirstNameNicknamed] must be cursing the day [portal_owner.GetSheHe] decided to keep the Dark Portal standing, for orcs under the command of the Elder Shaman Ner'zhul have used their twisted magics to usurp control of the dreaded structure for their own nefarious designs!\n\n"
 WCDRA_1000_DESC_rift:0 "The day that all denizens of Azeroth feared has come - the Dark Portal has been opened once more! The Elder Shaman Ner'zhul and his followers on Draenor have stabilized the rift from the other side and sent his forces into the Blasted Lands, right under [portal_owner.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] nose!\n\n"
 WCDRA_1000_DESC_ending:0 "Through trickery and guile, Ner'zhul's most trusted followers slipped past the defenders of the [portal_owner.Custom('GetPortalRift')] and set forth to recover a collection of powerful artifacts: the Book of Medivh, the Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras, and the Eye of Dalaran. No one can say for sure what he plans to do with all these artifacts, but all who call this world their home agree that he must be stopped at all costs!"

 WCDRA_1010_DESC:0 "Deathwing's trail was easy enough to follow, and as our champions close in on their quarry, they soon discover that the Aspect of Death is already being harried by another force. The mighty gronn, led by Gruul, and their ogre servants have been destroying every clutch of eggs that have been stashed in the area and impaling their protectors upon the mountain spires…\n\n[diplomat.GetFullNameNicknamed|U] suggests that a bargain could be made with Gruul in which we could offer our support in their battle against Deathwing so long as he leaves the artifact to us.\n\n[paranoid.GetFullNameNicknamed|U] argues that Gruul can't be trusted, and advises to instead let the monsters continue their battle and use the chaos to sneak in and retrieve the artifact undetected."

 WCDRA_1015_DESC:0 "While resting for the night, you awoke to the sound of shouting and a panicked, eerie squawking. Rushing out to find the source of the chaos, you saw a number of your warriors piled on top of an arakkoa, clad in deep purple robes and a dark cowl.\n\nAfter your warriors let [grizzik.GetHerHim] up, the arakkoa introduces [grizzik.GetHerselfHimself] as [grizzik.GetFirstName]. [grizzik.GetSheHe|U] claims to have only been watching your army out of mere curiosity, but when [grizzik.GetSheHe] hears that you seek to foil Ner'zhul's plans, [grizzik.GetHerHis] eyes gleam with a cunning and vengeful light. As a personal revenge against the Horde for what they've done to [grizzik.GetHerHis] people, [grizzik.GetFirstName] offers to guide you to Auchindoun, an ancient draenei burial ground, where Ner'zhul has apparently taken shelter."

 WCDRA_1015_OPT_C:0 "I feel... a strange aura around this creature."

 WCDRA_1020_DESC:0 "The assault of Auchindoun is a fierce battle, raging through bone-strewn halls and shadowed corridors. Your warriors are unnerved by the ancient architecture and unsettling ambience, and several report feeling watched in spaces that could not possibly hold an orc spy.\n\nThey fight valiantly nonetheless, and are joined by the ghosts of slain draenei conjured up by one of their last living members. The orcs put up a fearsome resistance, but between the courageous living and vengeful dead they are routed entirely.\n\nUnfortunately, the coward Ner'zhul manages to escape amidst the chaos."
 WCDRA_1020_OPT_A:0 "A hallowed victory."

 WCDRA_1025_DESC:0 "The world is ending! During your assault on the Black Temple, the sky suddenly darkens and the ground begins to quake - Ner'zhul's ritual is complete!\n\nOne must wonder whether or not he understood the grim price he would pay for his ambition. Several new portals have opened, but their tremendous energies are out of control! The very fabric of this world is being torn asunder, irrevocably dooming Draenor.\n\nThere is nothing more you can do. You must lead your troops back to the Dark Portal or be destroyed alongside this dying world!"
 WCDRA_1025_OPT_A:0 "Madness!"

 WCDRA_1030_DESC:0 "The Laughing Skull, one of the many savage orc clans infesting this world, bar your path. Maniacal and bloodthirsty even by orc standards, the Laughing Skull are known for madness and treachery.\n\nThese ones offer you a truce, however, if you agree to aid them in battle against their enemies, the Thunderlord and Bonechewer clans. A combined strike would probably be less costly than open battle against these orcs, but can you really trust these savages?"
 WCDRA_1030_OPT_A:0 "Deal!"

 WCDRA_1035_DESC:0 "You have reached the Dark Portal, but you know you will never see the other side of it again. The destruction is getting worse, the ground crumbling and the sky marred by strange lights. Draenor is doomed, and that doom will spread to Azeroth as well if the Dark Portal is not sealed.\n\nThe only way to do that is from this side, while holding off the waves of desperate orcs attempting to escape their dying world and blight Azeroth. It will be a noble last stand to save everything you know and love."

The shattered and twisted remains of it are now known as Outland.\n\nAzeroth is hardly unscathed either. The lands around the Dark Portal are blasted and lifeless, and the devastation left by the Orcish Horde is apparent everywhere, but no further threats should emerge from the portal any time soon. The brave heroes on the other side made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve their world, and for now at least, they appear to have succeeded."
