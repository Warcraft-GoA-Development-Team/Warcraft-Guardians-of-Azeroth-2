# This story cycle send the event a character should see when they discover a lover's/spouse's lover secret, or when a lover's/spouse's lover secret is exposed.

# It should be started by the secret_lover secret with these scripted effects:
# - start_infidelity_confrontation_story_discovery_effect
# - start_infidelity_confrontation_story_exposure_effect

# To get some special texts in the first event infidelity_confrontation.1000, you can save a variable on the secret before revealing/exposing it, and use the scripted effects to apply that variable to the story. Current special texts:
# - revealed_through_investigation_by_desc
# - revealed_through_confession_to_desc
