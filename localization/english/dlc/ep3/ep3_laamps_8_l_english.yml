ep3_laamps.8200.desc_1: "We are always on the move laden with our baggage, hastily unpacking when we stop, and stuffing it away moments later. Tents, pots, pans, spare weapons, a few precious items, and the food that sustains us on our endless travails.\n\nAs I try to take measure of the logistics of our next move, a towering passerby effortlessly raises one of our carts. One of my followers, clearly amused by this feat of strength, runs to me and pleads:\n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName], [new_person.GetSheHe] raised the whole cart over [new_person.GetHerHis] head, have you seen this! Can we keep [new_person.GetHerHim]? [new_person.GetSheHe|U] does not even need a weapon, [new_person.GetSheHe] can simply grab and throw our enemies! And [new_person.GetSheHe] already promised to carry my pack."\n\nSuch a [new_person.GetWomanMan] could prove [new_person.GetHerselfHimself] useful, carrying my pack as well. [new_person.GetSheHe|U] will eat a lot of provisions though."
ep3_laamps.8200.desc_2: "The night sky fills my camp with dread, lightened only by the flickering campfire. In glimpses, I see my followers' somber, tired faces. The lust of adventuring meets the grim reality tonight, the reality of waterlogged boots, eating last week's leftovers, and sleep interrupted by animals constantly rustling in groves.\n\nA single laugh breaks the gloom. Then another, and I see my stern followers turned into a gaggle of laughing children. Mirth in such darkness is a rare thing. I seek the source of the commotion, and soon [new_person.GetSheHe] appears in front of me, bowing deeply while still dancing, and speaks:\n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetNameNoTooltip], we finally meet! Allow me to introduce myself, I am [new_person.GetName], a jester extraordinaire. I once performed for the great [location.county.holder.top_liege.GetName]! And I made [location.county.holder.top_liege.GetHerHim] laugh, right when they poured buckets of water on me! Alas, the strands of fate have torn me away from my troupe. Now, I offer myself to you and your humor."

The locals have been frequently visiting our camp, to trade, or simply to hang around. Recently I saw a [new_person.GetWomanMan] lingering around for longer than the rest. Almost as if looking for an excuse to not go back to [new_person.GetHerHis] village, to stay with us and travel to new lands.\n\nThere is always work for an able bodied soul in my camp, but should we invite every stray puppy? Today, [new_person.GetSheHe] mustered enough courage to make a proposition, standing in front of me with these prepared words:\n\n"There have been lean years and fat years here in [location.county.GetNameNoTier]. And I reckon, the lean years are coming back. The signs are there for those who can see. Please, I do not wish to die where I was born, to stay here, any longer. I humbly ask, allow me to join your band, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U].""
