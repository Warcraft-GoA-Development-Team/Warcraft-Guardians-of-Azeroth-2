Seeing the chaos as a golden opportunity to reclaim the heartland, the human vestige in Silverpine Forest prepares for the final confrontation with the undead, but there are concerns about the future of the kingdom should they come out victorious in their campaign, as the fate of the last living heir is still unclear to the chain of command, making it difficult to decide to whom should the crown of Lordaeron ultimately go..."
