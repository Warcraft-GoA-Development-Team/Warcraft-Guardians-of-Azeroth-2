 building_curtain_walls_01:1 "Bastions & Curtain Walls"
 building_curtain_walls_01_desc:1 "The first step for any respectable fortification is the erection of bastions and curtain walls. They do a decent job of keeping enemies (and rioting peasants) at bay."

 building_curtain_walls_07_desc:1 "The Trace Italienne, or bastion fort, is a type of defensive structure that can resist even the relentless pounding of cannons. Well, not for very long, but at least for long enough to allow safe escape through the secret tunnels..."
 building_curtain_walls_08:1 "Ravelins & Cavaliers"
 building_curtain_walls_08_desc:1 "The cavalier is a raised platform which allows our soldiers to fire over the main parapet, right at the enemies! Unfortunately, this also means that the enemies know exactly where to aim their shots... Though soldiers positioned on the ravelins, which are triangular outworks that divide besieging enemies, can do their best to prevent this from happening."
 
 building_type_cereal_fields_01:1 "Farms & Fields"

 building_cereal_fields_04:1 "Farmsteads"
 building_cereal_fields_04_desc:1 "Larger farmsteads support larger peasant families. When families have space to grow, they will produce children that can be put to toil in the fields – as is the natural order of things!"

 building_cereal_fields_06:1 "Granges & Tithe Barns"
 building_cereal_fields_06_desc:1 "Tithe barns act as a place for farmers to put the portion of their produce that should befall the clergy – of course, this also makes it easier for us to tax them."
 building_cereal_fields_07:1 "Vast Crop Fields"
 building_cereal_fields_07_desc:1 "By 'encouraging' our grateful peasant subjects to till more and larger fields closer to each other's lands, we are sure to get a higher yield.

 building_cereal_fields_08:1 "Grain Silos"
 building_cereal_fields_08_desc:1 "These massive silos aim to store grain in vast quantities throughout the entire year. There's so much that no single army can consume it all, of course, that is presuming that no rats enter the silos..."

 building_barracks_01:1 "Wooden Barracks"

 building_barracks_02:1 "Levying Grounds"
 building_barracks_02_desc:1 "By clearing a large swathe of land of any obstructions, we can muster our soldiers in one place for division into units. The clear vision also allows for easier spotting of deserters."
 building_barracks_03:1 "Stone Barracks"
 building_barracks_03_desc:1 "The sturdier stone barracks offer significantly more protection from the elements, and the carrying of the stones is great training for our men! A 'team-building' exercise, if you will."
 building_barracks_04:1 "Mobile Camps"
 building_barracks_04_desc:1 "The nature of the barrack is to be mobile, and what better way to stay mobile than to use sturdy and durable leather tents? Those farmers didn't need their livestock anyway!"
 building_barracks_05:1 "Smithies"
 building_barracks_05_desc:1 "By enlisting camp smiths to maintain our levies' rusted spears and bent forks, we significantly increase our chances of success, even though the smiths might have preferred something just a little bit more prestigious."

 building_barracks_07_desc:1 "By constructing dedicated conscription centers in all nearby villages, we ensure a steady stream of ill-willed, alcoholized troublemakers to swell our ranks."
 building_barracks_08:1 "Permanent Barracks"

 building_camel_farms_07:1 "Armorers"
