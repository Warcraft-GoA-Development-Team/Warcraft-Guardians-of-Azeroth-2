#### Create Random Building - 2 Part Effect ####

# creates a random building in a holding, limited by innovations and holding level, and weighted to cheapest/lowest level, excludes tribal holdings/buildings, only for use in castle/church/city baronies

# ensure the event/script where this is used checks that a building can be built, based on innovations and holding level, as if noe can be built this effect will do absolutely nada
