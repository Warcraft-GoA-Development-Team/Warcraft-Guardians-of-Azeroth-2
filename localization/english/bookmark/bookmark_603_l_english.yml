 bm_the_reign_of_chaos_desc:0 "Years after the end of the Second War, the Eastern Kingdoms are yet to recover entirely from the ravage it caused to lands and people alike. The Alliance is weakened by political and economical crises. Quel'Thalas and other kingdoms distanced themselves from Lordaeron to pursue their own isolated destinies; remnants of the Horde and rebels are still fighting on, while a mysterious epidemic appears in Lordaeron's Eastweald. Rumors spread around the kingdom of a mad prophet's warning to flee an incoming doom and the necessity to flee to the west. Still, prince Arthas Menethil intends to fight on and safeguard his people and his future realm.\nElsewhere, in the arctic continent of Northrend, contact has been lost with all human settlements and colonies. The powerful local empires of the Nerubians and Drakkari Trolls once so mighty are retreating from a new rising power, the Lich King. This mysterious being raises undead armies and prepares for war against the living. Few can oppose him in the north and he might have plans for the rest of the world, too...\n\nWill the kingdoms of the Alliance stick together to face this new crisis or will they split apart driven by survival or interest? Will the Lich King succeed where the Horde failed and bring doom to Azeroth? Who will emerge the victor from the Reign of Chaos?"

The mage, however, is also an expert on the magic of the Sunwell, Quel'Thalas's main source of power, as well as in the arts of magical buildings and esoteric studies. Despite all his accomplishments, Dar'Khan lacks the recognition he deserves and aspires to more than what his ungrateful peers accept to grant him, yet he knows he is capable to achieve greatness and leave his mark on history.

Even the secluded elves can't ignore the events of the world forever. What destiny awaits the elven king and his people? To prosper secluded in their magical kingdom?
