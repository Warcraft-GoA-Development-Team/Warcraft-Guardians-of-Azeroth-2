=== Custom Widgets ===

Custom widgets can be embedded into events.
GUI files must be placed at the event_window_widgets path (see paths.settings). The name of the file must match the widget name.

Some widgets that modify the game require a custom controller. This should be documented in the widget's GUI file.
The data context type available in the GUI depends on the controller type.

Some controllers require special scope setup, which should be documented under Notes below. Use the setup_scope effect for that.

Available controllers:

Controller Type	| Data Context Name				  | Notes
-------------------+------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------
default			| EventWindowWidget				  | Default controller, no special behavior
name_character	 | EventWindowWidgetNameCharacter	 | Changes a character's name. Scope must have the name_character_target saved scope.
