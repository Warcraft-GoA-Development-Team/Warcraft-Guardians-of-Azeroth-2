### AI Note
The liege and vassal desire are used as follows:
When finding the most desired level to change we check if any ajdacent obligation level to the currently active ones are desired by them more. Desires less than or equal to zero are not considered and if the score is less then or equal to the desire of the current level it is also not considered.

The does_ai_liege_in_vassal_contract_desire_obligation_change and does_ai_vassal_in_vassal_contract_desire_obligation_change triggers check that we have any obligation level change desired at all.

The apply_ai_vassal_obligation_vassal_most_desired and apply_ai_vassal_obligation_liege_most_desired effects apply the desired option via a weighted random of the desire score of all valid desired levels.
