 WCHOI_2_TITLE:0 "The Invasion from Draenor"
 WCHOI_2_DESC:0 "A storm brews over the southern reaches of Azeroth, within the Black Morass. A gateway, the Dark Portal, has been opened to a dying world known as Draenor — home to wild beasts, orcs, ogres and many other vile creatures. Bloodthirsty and in search of new lands, the orcish clans have united beneath a powerful Warchief who rules the Horde with an iron first. Now they seek to go through the Dark Portal and conquer Azeroth!"
 WCHOI_2_OPT_A:0 "Lok'tar ogar!"
 WCHOI_2_OPT_B:0 "Let us wait and see what happens."
 WCHOI_2_OPT_C:0 "Something must be done about this!"
 
 WCHOI_3_DESC:0 "It is time to stop this carnage. The Horde has conquered enough land to start a new life in Azeroth. Many orcs are returning to their families, burying their axes in the ground. They have vowed to forget the horrors of war that they had to go through. The warlords of the Horde still pose a threat to some parts of Azeroth, but the bloodiest wars are behind us since the clans no longer see the point in keeping the Horde united."
 WCHOI_3_OPT_A:0 "The orcs need their warchief!"
 WCHOI_3_OPT_B:0 "We will go our own way."
 ITS_OVER:0 "It is over..."

 horde_invite_bloodthirsty_clans_desc:0 "A lot of orcs are left beyond the Dark Portal. We need all the clans, if we want to gain a foothold in Azeroth."

 horde_invite_bloodthirsty_clans_confirm:0 "Summon them"
 
 LOKTAR_OGAR:0 "Lok'tar ogar!"
 EVTDESC_WCFTW_4:0 "Draenor continues to slowly die. Now, none of the orcs have a desire to remain on a perishing world. Those who were left on Draenor are now hungry, sick and insane... but have crossed the line between the worlds. Among them are the most bloodthirsty bands of orcs, who inspire fear and respect in other, less virulent clans. The clans of the Burning Blade and the Dragonmaw will overwhelm anyone who stands in the way of the Horde."
