Dynamic combat advantage modifiers

name = loc_key			# effect display name
advantage = int			# advantage bonus for static effects or multiplier for dynamic effects
adjacency = yes/no		# if this is an adjacency effect
fortification = yes/no	# if this is a fortification effect
visible = yes/no		# yes - this effect should appear in advantage breakdown as is, no - code takes care of substituting proper modifiers for a detailed breakdown
image = key 			# Use this key for the icon instead of the actual key of the modifier
