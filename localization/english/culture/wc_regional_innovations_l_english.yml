 innovation_gryphon:0 "Gryphon Taming"
 innovation_gryphon_desc:0 "Gryphons are majestic creatures of the skies, and are, much like wyverns, more than just beasts. They both are intelligent as well as cunning. Our tamers have successfully learned how to communicate with and tame these flying creatures."

 innovation_kodo:0 "Kodo Taming"
 innovation_kodo_desc:0 "Tauren legends abound regarding the great horned kodos of Kalimdor's Barrens. Some myths tell of rare kodos that are bound to the spirits of the sky and storm, thus allowing the colossal beasts to harness the powers of lightning itself. While kodos are generally considered gentle by nature, they are fierce opponents when threatened and have occasionally been known to devour their enemies whole. Our tamers have successfully learned how to communicate with and tame these grand creatures."

 innovation_wyvern:0 "Wyvern Taming"
 innovation_wyvern_desc:0 "Wyverns share a common ancestry with both dragons and gryphons and hail from some of the most inhospitable regions of Kalimdor. Our tamers have successfully learned how to communicate with and tame these flying creatures."

 innovation_arachnathid:0 "Arachnathid Taming"
 innovation_arachnathid_desc:0 "Vicious and cunning, the arachnathid are among the most dangerous creatures in Northrend. They are ideal guardians for our people, as they live underground with us and are highly territorial. Our tamers have reported they respond well to training and will likely be a formidable asset." 

 innovation_dragonhawk:0 "Dragonhawk Taming"
 innovation_dragonhawk_desc:0 "Dragonhawks have long been symbolic of Quel’Thalas: majestic, powerful, and deadly when provoked. Our people have forged a strong bond with them, and should our tamers be successful in domesticating them, that bond could only grow stronger."

 innovation_mushan:0 "Mushan Taming"
 innovation_mushan_desc:0 "Similar to their kodo cousins, mushans are often used as beasts of burden by the people of Pandaria. Despite that, we believe that they could be equally valuable in warfare, and our tamers have begun training mushans to accept armor and riders."
