 wc_horde_invasion.medivh.1000.desc:0 "My entire body trembles as I utter the final syllables of the incantation. The storm roars with intensified fury, as if the heavens themselves refuse what I am about to do.\n\nBefore me, the stones shift with a terrifying rumble as the Dark Portal rises, immense and menacing. Its dark energy pulses through the air, and a magical vortex swirls around its frame. There is no turning back now...\nI raise my arms, invoking the forces of the Nether, and with a deafening crash, the Portal opens, releasing a chilling mist. I can feel them, on the other side: the Orcs.\n\nMy duty fulfilled, I use the last of my energy to recall myself to Karazhan. I light a fire and collapse before the flames, letting out a weary sigh. That wretched warlock... He will undoubtedly betray us, but he will have to wait before we deem him worthy of our attention. The fate of Azeroth is sealed, and what I have done today will usher in an era of chaos and unprecedented destruction upon our world."

The warlords of the Horde still pose a threat to some parts of Azeroth, but the bloodiest wars are behind us since the clans no longer see the point in keeping the Horde united."

Those who were left on Draenor are now hungry, sick and insane... but have crossed the line between the worlds. Among them are the most bloodthirsty bands of orcs, who inspire fear and respect in other, less virulent clans. The clans of the Burning Blade and the Dragonmaw will overwhelm anyone who stands in the way of the Horde."
