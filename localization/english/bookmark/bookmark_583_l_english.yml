 bm_the_invasion_from_draenor_desc:1 "Years after the end of the Gurubashi war, a new threat of war rises over Azeroth. The Dark Portal, a rift between the worlds of Azeroth and Draenor, has been opened in the Black Marsh east to the unsuspecting kingdom. Through it came the Orcish Horde, eager to claim Azeroth for its own.\nThe Horde's ambitious warchief, Blackhand, is preparing for a glorious campaign to add a second world to his path of glory. Minorities such as noble chieftain Durotan's Frostwolf clan refuse to follow Blackhand's destructive way and only wish to flee their dying world. Whatever their motivation might be, it changes nothing for king Llane and the humans of Stormwind who will fight to the death to defend their homeland.\nIt is not only a story of kings and warchiefs, though, for unknown to sides, war is a game of chess between sorcerers' masterminds and their secret agenda. The human Medivh and the orc Gul'dan opened the Dark Portal for reasons of their own, and they are not done, yet...\n\n#bold Will the Horde plunge Azeroth into endless bloodshed?
