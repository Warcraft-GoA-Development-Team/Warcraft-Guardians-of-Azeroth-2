story_thunder_king = { # Thunder King Crisis by Juke
	# The Thunder King Lei Shen is resurrected and begins his reconquest of Pandaria
	# Can be done (By player and, less likely, by AI) via decision, or it can trigger randomly (see gamerule)
	# https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Lei_Shen
	# Juke note: I originally handled this through on_actions and hidden events, hence a lot of effects are contained in events and scripted effects
	# This makes it a bit harder to get an overview of all the events, but makes debugging a bit easier
	# If this is broken in the future or something message me on discord: juketm
