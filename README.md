This branch has static models for the following races:

Centaur

Dryad

Gnoll

Gorloc

Harpy

Hozen

Magnataur

Mogu

Naga

Pandaren

Wolvar



Some races have separate static models for male and female characters. Pandaren use the child model for their females because I kept running into issues with broken normals on the Pandaren Female model when trying to import it. All Dryads use the female dryad model, since I ran into broken normals issues when importing the Keeper of the Grove model (plus creature_keeper is a separate trait from creature_dryad, so I think this is intended anyway.) 
Some models have issues with transparency on their textures causing pieces behind the transparent part of the texture to be completely invisible. I'm not sure what causes this issue.

I tried to set up the gnoll model to have multiple different textures (which are still included in the files), but couldn't get it working.

I tried to import models for Tauren, Yaungol, Taunka, and Saurok, too, but had issues with broken normals.

Harpies and Naga, which originally had the Night Elf ethnicity in the base mod, still have the Night elf eyebrows present despite being added to the list of race traits with no portrait.
