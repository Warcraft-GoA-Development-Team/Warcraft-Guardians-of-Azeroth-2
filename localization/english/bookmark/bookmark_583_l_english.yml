 bm_the_invasion_from_draenor_desc:1 "Years after the end of the Gurubashi war, a new threat of war rises over Azeroth. The Dark Portal, a rift between the worlds of Azeroth and Draenor, has been opened in the Black Marsh east to the unsuspecting kingdom. Through it came the Orcish Horde, eager to claim Azeroth for its own.\nThe Horde's ambitious warchief, Blackhand, is preparing for a glorious campaign to add a second world to his path of glory. Minorities such as noble chieftain Durotan's Frostwolf clan refuse to follow Blackhand's destructive way and only wish to flee their dying world. Whatever their motivation might be, it changes nothing for king Llane and the humans of Stormwind who will fight to the death to defend their homeland.\nIt is not only a story of kings and warchiefs, though, for unknown to sides, war is a game of chess between sorcerers' masterminds and their secret agenda. The human Medivh and the orc Gul'dan opened the Dark Portal for reasons of their own, and they are not done, yet...\n\nWill the Horde plunge Azeroth into endless bloodshed? Will the orcs find a new world to inhabit, or will they be pushed back to the doomed world of Draenor? What darker schemes await Azeroth?"

 #Llane Wrynn
 llane_wrynn_character:0 "King Llane"
 llane_wrynn_character_desc:0 "A knightly king, Llane was raised in the bond of brotherhood with his close friends knight-champion Anduin Lothar and Medivh, the Guardian. Alongside his friends and advisors, the young king defeated the trolls who killed his father during the Gurubashi War. Llane has proven himself true to the legacy of the Wrynn dynasty as Stormwind has become the mightiest it has ever been. With the invasion from Draenor incoming, Llane now has to face a threat more terrible than any of his ancestors did. The war to come may bring doom to Llane's entire people and legacy, but were he to succeed, he would be remembered as the greatest of all kings. Can his friends help him repel the incoming darkness?"

 #Medivh

 medivh_character_desc:0 "Son of the court conjurer of Stormwind and of Aegwynn, the Guardian of Tirisfal, Medivh is the greatest scion of a spellcaster lineage. He became the hero of the kingdom during the Gurubashi War and became endeared with king Llane. Having succeeded his mother as Guardian, Medivh might be the most powerful mortal mage in the world. His ultimate task is to safeguard Azeroth from the direst threats. However, he has not been seen outside his lordship of Karazhan for some time. Many wonder what the Guardian has been up to.\n\nWill Medivh be able to save Stormwind once again? Does he have another plan? What fate awaits the tower of Karazhan in the middle of the war to come?"

 #Blackhand
 blackhand_character:0 "Warchief Blackhand"
 blackhand_character_desc:0 "Nicknamed, 'destroyer', Blackhand is the chieftain of the Blackrock clan, the most powerful and populous clan of the Horde. Chosen by his fellow chieftains and the influential warlock Gul'Dan to be warchief of the Horde and military overlord of the united orc clans. With the Horde starving of both combat and resources, the warchief is proud to lead his warriors into the conquest of Azeroth. Only conquest will secure new lands to rule, and his position as the one true leader of the orcs despite the will of idealistic chieftains, ambitious commanders, and scheming warlocks...\nWill Blackhand bring Azeroth to its knees and find his path to glory as the uncontested ruler of the Horde? Will conflicts within the Horde put an end to the warchief's ambition? Whatever may happen, there will be bloodshed..."

 #Gul'dan
 guldan_character:0 "Gul'dan"
 guldan_character_desc:1 "Born a rejected cripple, Gul'dan was determined not to be stopped in his quest for greatness. Once an apprentice to elder shaman Ner'zhul, spiritual leader of the orcs, Gul'dan replaced him and introduced a new magical way, the arts of the warlocks. Gul'dan assembled the clans into the Horde and his magic led them to Azeroth through the Portal, yet he was neither chieftain nor warrior and had to share power with a more warlike figurehead in the person of warchief Blackhand. As long as he is cooperative, Blackhand can play with his toy soldiers, for a greater destiny awaits the warlock... for now...\n\nWill Gul'dan achieve direct control over the Horde? Will the warchief's pride be an obstacle to the warlock's ambition? Will the powers awaiting in Azeroth finally lead to Gul'dan's end?"

 #Durotan
 durotan_character:0 "Chieftain Durotan"
 durotan_character_desc:0 "Son and successor of the wise Garad, Durotan leads the Frostwolf clan. He and his clan prefer to follow the ancient way and would have stayed in peaceful reclusion were they not forced into the Horde to survive. Opposed to the Horde's dark way of warlocks and warmongers, Durotan still believes the orcs need to escape the barren wasteland that Draenor has become, and he knows that opposing Blackhand and Gul'dan directly could endanger his people...\n\nWill Durotan spare his clan from the Horde's damnation? Will his people fall to corruption? Will he assist in bringing the Horde to an end at the humans' hands?"
