 # Religious Head of Faith Interactions
 wc_religious_interaction.1010:0 "After much deliberation I have decided to repent for my poor deeds. For the Inquisition to mark me as a heretic was entirely pertinent.\n\nI know that my shortcomings caused me to become marked, but those qualities will not outshine me as a follower of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName]. If the Inquisition, by the grace of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName], decided to have some mercy on me, I would be most grateful."
 wc_religious_interaction.1010.accept:0 "Very well, [actor.GetName], we accept your surrender."
 wc_religious_interaction.1010.refuse:0 "You are not yet worthy of redemption, [actor.GetName]..."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011:0 "We have received your letter, [actor.GetTitledFirstName]. The Inquisition is grateful for your willing surrender. Agents are already on their way to take you into custody, and you are expected to cooperate with them to the greatest of your ability.\n\nKnow that this will not spare you from the rigors of true penance, but because you chose not to flee or fight the Inquisition may win you the trust of some."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.cynical:0 "Let's get this over with."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.zealous:0 "Do your worst, inquisitors, faith is my strength."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.deceitful:0 "I knew it would come to this, I am prepared."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.arrogant:0 "Your inquisitors cannot break me."
 wc_religious_interaction.1011.normal:0 "I know that I am innocent, as will they."
 wc_religious_interaction.1012:0 "We have received your letter, [actor.GetTitledFirstName]. The Inquisition has chosen not to accept your surrender. Spoken plainly, we don't intend to allow the guilty to choose their own terms. Regardless, one who cares for his soul would cooperate when the time comes."
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.deceitful:0 "They must suspect a trap."
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.paranoid:0 "They don't want a confession, they want my head!"
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.zealous:0 "They will not deny me this!"
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.cynical:0 "Their forgiveness means nothing to me anyways."
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.arrogant:0 "Only [GetFaith.HighGodName] can truly deny me."
 wc_religious_interaction.1012.normal:0 "Perhaps they've bigger concerns than me..."

 wc_religious_interaction.1020:0 "Several of your peers have found your faith and morals lacking. [actor.GetTitledFirstName] has personally attested to your many failings, and I fear that I cannot let them go unpunished."
 wc_religious_interaction.1021:0 "For too long your actions have gone unnoticed, but this ends today. You are suspected of betraying the tenants of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]. You must stand trial before the [actor.GetFaith.ReligiousHeadTitleName] or be branded a heretic. May [actor.GetFaith.HighGodName] have mercy on your soul... For we will not."
 wc_religious_interaction.1022:0 "[actor.GetTitledFirstName], your tales of [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] heresies concern me. To think that such villainy could occur under my watch is sickening, I have deemed it necessary to place the Scarlet Mark upon [secondary_recipient.GetHerHim|l].\n\nI mark [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstName], branding him an enemy to [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]."
 wc_religious_interaction.1023:0 "The mission of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate] is most righteous, and demands its followers to be equally so. It is every fighter of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternatePossessive] duty to look upon his comrades and ensure their loyalty and faith, and to call out whoever errs.\n\nHowever, your request to have [secondary_recipient.GetTitledFirstName] with the Scarlet Mark has been denied. Whatever guilt you see in [secondary_recipient.GetHerHim|l], the Inquisition has not found. I would advise you to be more careful with your accusations, lest the conclave begin to suspect you to be hiding secrets yourself."
 wc_religious_interaction.1024:0 "[recipient.GetTitledFirstName], you bear the Scarlet Mark, branding you an irredeemable heretic. Your failings, that which brought about your branding, have not been forgiven, but we believe that they can be redeemed.\n\nThe time you spent Marked has clearly changed you for the better. I has deemed it fit for the Scarlet Mark to be removed. From now and forward, you may rejoin the ranks of the Faithful."
 wc_religious_interaction.1025:0 "WIP"
 wc_religious_interaction.1110:0 "We've recieved your prisoner, [actor.GetFirstName], and we are most delighted that you've sent [recipient.GetHerHim|l] to repent with our guidance. The Inquisition recognizes such strong followers of [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate] like yourself, and will reward you appropriately."
 wc_religious_interaction.1110.zealous:0 "It was my duty to bring [recipient.GetHerHim|l] to justice."
 wc_religious_interaction.1110.vengeful:0 "This is just a fraction of what [recipient.GetHerHim|l] deserves..."
 wc_religious_interaction.1110.normal:0 "For [actor.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]!"
 wc_religious_interaction.1115:0 "Your vile presence has corrupted my dungeons for far too long. My faith has given me wisdom and strength, and with that wisdom comes with my decision to send you to the Inquisition.\n\nThis does not absolve you of your crimes completely, as you will now be at the mercy of [inquisitor.GetName]..."
